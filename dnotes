	graphics-info-defines whether such a function exists and has
	all the number of picks that it needs, if it does and it
	doesn't then collect them and pass them on when it has all
	it needs.  When the function has been called delete it from
	the queue/vector of such functions (umm, better do the
	deletion just before the function call so that if there is an

	deletion part).

   How about some flexibility in file name output?

     How difficult is it to create (or, maybe, How would one go about
     creating a) naming system for output PDB files that is consonant
     with my usage?  Currently COOT gives a default of
     input_file_name-coot-0.pdb.  I typically name my files
     model_0i.pdb for the file out of refinement (before ligand, hence
     the zero -- yes I do it too ;-) ) and my first output file as
     model_0o1.pdb.  If I do some "editing" outside of COOT, I might
     then create model_0i2.pdb and if I make some changes inside COOT,
     the output file would be model_0o2.pdb, etc.  After the next
     cycle of refinement, I would come in with model_1i.pdb, etc.

-----
Tue Aug 21 14:44:14 BST 2007

	Note to self:

	B factor average, variance vs resolution for each residue type.

	Probably best to have a shell script to provide the pdb files

	c++ program reads pdbs and does b-factor analysis,

            on completion appends to files "ARG.tab" "ASP.tab" etc
            with average and variance for each residue of that type in
            that pdb file.  Also the resolution.

	    only do 1 chain of each pdb file.

            use Coot libs - make it a Coot program.

    Plans for multi-stick representations

    class line_representation {
      representation_type { atom_bond, CA, CA+ligand etc }
      bonds_container
      displayed_flag

      colour_rotation

        resno_1
        resno_2;
	insode_1;
	insode_2;
      }
    };

    We shall use a std::vector<line_representation> line_rep_vec;
    New items are pushed back.  You can't delete an item from this
    vector, mearly not display it (the handles are passed back - and
    we don't want them to go out of date).

    Particular alt confs cannot be selected for.

    Questions:  How shall we create new representations for this molecule?

    // return
    int add_representation imol representation-spec

    // used by GUI
    undisplay_representation imol respresentation-number

    undisplay_representation imol residue_spec
    which needs to be unambiguated. Test in this order:

     o Was there a line_representation that has that residue_spec?
     o Was there a residue_range line_representation that encompassed that residue_spec?
     o Was that residue in a chain that has a line_representation?

"My view is that I don't want to see all 3 of these in the list, one would do. "

    How To Add Another Geometry Graph

    in geometry_graphs.hh:
    --------------------------
    Add new type to geometry_graph_type

    in geometry_graphs.cc
    --------------------------
    In the coot::geometry_graphs::geometry_graphs(...) constructor, add title

    in graphics-info-graphs.cc
    --------------------------
    graphics_info_t::update_geometry_graphs(...)
    Add a function to update new graph.

      coot::geometry_graphs *gr =
	 geometry_graph_dialog_to_object(residue_density_fit_graph[imol_moving_atoms]);
	 std::vector<coot::geometry_graph_block_info_generic> dv =
	    geomtry_graph_xxx_from_mol(moving_atoms_asc_local,
				 imol_moving_atoms,
				 Imol_Refinement_Map());
	 gr->update_residue_blocks(dv);

    Create a function:
    void graphics_info_t::xxx_graphs(int imol)...


    in c-interface-xxx.cc
    ----------------------
      void validation_graph_XXX_mol_selector_activate (GtkMenuItem     *menuitem,
						      gpointer         user_data);
   in main.cc
   ----------
   Add create_initial_validation_graph_submenu_generic
   The menu name (the first string) must match the names generated by the glade

   in callbacks.c
   --------------
  char *type = "density-fit";
  GtkWidget *menu = lookup_widget(GTK_WIDGET(menuitem), "density_fit_analysis1");
  if (menu) {
    add_on_validation_graph_mol_options(menu, type);
  } else {
    printf("failed to get menu in on_density_fit1_activate\n");
  }

   in c-interface-validate.cc
   -------------------------

   Add another option to add_on_validation_graph_mol_options()

   The validation_type must match that from callbacks.c
   The sub_menu_name must match that from main.cc
     create_initial_validation_graph_submenu_generic()

   Also unset_geometry_graph(GtkWidget *dialog) needs to know about the new graph

   in graphics_info_graphs.cc
   --------------------------
   set_validation_graph need to know about the new graph

    Really test out Ca Zone -> Mainchain.

    It seems to me that most of the time it works well, but there are
    regions where it does not. e.g. CA - N bonds of less than 0.5A.
    I am thinking that that can only be coming from a bug.

    Think about how to test that.

    Very few reference structures?

    We need to know how many fragment are contributing to each

    Now I am compiling gtk2+ becuase the system gtk2+ on cycle (FC4)
    is too old to complile Coot.

    I am doing it on cycle in ~/compile
    I created setup pango-glib-gtk2 with PKG_CONFIG settings.
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4

    glib 2.12.13 straightforward
    pango 1.16.4 straightforward
    fine.
    Oh for gtk2 though, cairo is not an option.  It is a must.  Baah.
    That was not clear in www.gtk.org.

    So get cairo 1.4.14 from http://cairographics.org/releases/

    which means get glitz from http://cairographics.org/snapshots/
    (gotta have glitz, right?)

    glitz-0.5.6
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    back to cairo
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4 --enable-glitz
    This displays a warning about using glitz, but configures OK.
    Compiles OK.

    back to pango:
    now with cairo in place, pango's configure finds cairo
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    back to Gtk2+:
    glib version test failed, so need to add LD_LIBRARY_PATH too (to the setup file)
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    Fine.  But Coot configure fails on gtlglExt

    http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gtkglext/gtkglext-1.2.0.tar.gz?modtime=1139081517&big_mirror=1
    back to GtkGLExt:
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    Coot now compiles OK.  And runs! Great.
    But - it doesn't load svgs.

    OK, back-up.

    config.log for cairo tells us we need a newer librsvg:
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/librsvg/2.20/
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/librsvg/2.20/librsvg-2.20.0.tar.gz (2 days old at
    time of writting)

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Warns us that we are not compiling with libcroco.
    Oh well.

    OK, now librsvg is in place configure finds it.
    Rebuilding cairo
    Install.

    Fine.  Now coot loads its svgs.  Yay!

    PyGtk needs pycairo


    Correct build order:
    glitz
    glib
    librsvg
    cairo
    pango
    gtk+-2
    glkglext

Hmm...


checking for LIBRSVG... configure: error: Package requirements (        gdk-pixbuf-2.0 >= 1.3.7         glib-2.0 >= 2.12.0      libxml-2.

Requested 'pangoft2 >= 1.2.0' but version of Pango FT2 is 1.1.1

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/cairo.html

  Note that the GTK, Poppler and librsvg packages are circular in that
  using them for test suite coverage requires installing cairo first,
  then installing the desired package(s), then installing cairo again.

 Use cluster volume vs contour threshhold plot (of the difference map)

 about that).

 there is some sort of shape function too (I missed how).  ah, 7

    Frank:

   "torsion general - crappy tail?"  I think I meant: why can't one
   use torsion general to swing a whole lot of protein around a main
   chain bond?  If I try, the mouse just clears after the 4th click.
   i.e., all I can move around is a miserable little tail of a
   sidechain, maybe.  Oh wait, I see now: yes, torsion general works
   only inside a residue.  Which is a bit anal, what if I want to
   swivel a whole domain or helix when it's changed from the MR model.
   Other place of nuisance: when modelling around in poor density at
   the end of a chain.

   "Ramachandran boundaries".  Ah yes: any reason why you don't have
   the same smooth boundaries that Richardsons use?  I've seen cases
   just outside your boundaries, but happily inside the Richardson
   one.

   "Views file: #Views".  Yes, the views file coot writes out itself
   doesn't load back.  Reason is (I remember) that the second (or
   third line) contains #Views, which screws up scheme.

   "Save coords: most recently changed".  Oh yes: could you populate
   the defaults (molecule; filename) based on the file most recently
   changed, and not on the one currently active?  These are not always
   the same, and chances are I want to save what I just built at, not
   what I was looking at.

Randy Read:
Some time back I sent you a bug report about split-screen stereo.  Don't know
if you've been able to reproduce it, but since then I've worked out the
problems.  Basically, coot doesn't like the "Side by Side (Wall Eyed)" option
any more.  Part of the problem is the saved state.  If the saved state is
Mono or normal "Side by Side", then you're fine -- coot comes up the way you
left it.  (Don't know about hardware, as I don't have access to an
appropriate machine.)  If the saved state is "Side by Side (Wall Eyed)", then
Draw -> Stereo... brings up a box claiming that you're still in that mode,
but the view is a mono one.  The only way to get wall-eyed stereo from this
state is to click "Mono" then "Side by Side" then finally "Side by Side (Wall
Eyed)".  If you come up in Mono mode, you also can't go directly to
wall-eyed -- first you have to go into normal side-by-side mode.

I am using coot 0.5 pre 958 and noticed that after resizing the
window of the ramachandran plot and possibly zooming in (with the
right mouse) the scroll bars don't allow to pan over the plot. Only
under extreme zoom, the scroll bars allow a little bit of
adjustment. I have over 2000 residues and need to zoom and scroll a
bit if I want to click on residues.

I do get error messages on the
terminal that might help:

** CRITICAL **: file gtk-canvas.c: line 3518
** (gtk_canvas_set_pixels_per_unit): a ssertion `n >
** GTK_CANVAS_EPSILON' failed.

The same message repeats presumably every
time I scroll(?) or perphas zoom.

Also, I noticed after a long search that the -key zooms out after I
had zoomed in with the right-mouse. Could zooming out be added to the
mouse perhaps like Shift-right-mouse ?

Another feature of coot would be good: Show ramachandran plots by
chains that the user select i.e. a plot with one chain at a time.

$ elal -pdb ~/data/rnase/tutorial-modern.pdb -map tmp.map -lib $warpbin/elal.lib

[there has to be a calculated map too, somewhere]

For checking carbohydrates:

wwww.glycosciences.de/tools/pdb-care


"ramachandran plots for carbohydrates"

however, need to do it for each linkage type.

  Sugar puckers

     RNA sugar pucker (C3' endo or C2' endo) is strongly correlated to
     the perpendicular distance between the following (3') phosphate
     and either the plane of the base or the C1'-N1/9 glycosidic bond
     vector. Incorrectly chosen sugar puckers also often result in
     out-of-range values for the epsilon dihedral. This is important
     information, because a sugar pucker is very difficult to
     determine directly from the electron density at resolutions
     typical for large RNAs. MolProbity checks epsilon angles and
     checks the modeled sugar pucker against the base-phosphate
     distance; it flags outliers as potentially having the wrong
     pucker.

    Fun: How about a script to make ray traced images of ligands at

    have different ligands).  Need to find structures with data of
    course.  Consider using j-multi-read, get the matrices and apply
    them to their maps.  Maybe that is not needed, because we are not
    going to look at the overlapped maps anyway, just ligands in the
    binding sites.

    Data needs to be formatted differently in the
    text control file - we need a specification of the mtz file and
    column labels too.

 o The build+test+tar+(copies+)publish process itself - build-it, runs
   on all up to hosts several times a day

 o The process that cleans up the build directory - every day, deletes
   everthing more than 7 day old

 o The process that deletes "old" pre-release build tar files from the
   web - runs every day, deleting everything more than 30 days old

 o The process that makes a web page from the build results - runs
   every 5 minutes, examining results from fedrated builds

	It's not the algorithms

   After the release, there are no pre-release source tars, so the
   build web page builder fails (a list-ref of a #f list)

   Python 2.5.2 build tests are failing with sendmail on FC5 (after
   re-install?)

   Crash on CentOS 4 machines when trying to read svgs

   Trying to separate python build logs from non-python build
   logs. Problems! overlapping dependencies, test the tar file and
   transfer it - many fixes to sort out.

   Coot builds on 32 and 64 bit systems.  In which directory should
   the libraries go?  By convention, 32 bit libs in prefix/lib and 64
   bit libs in prefix/lib64.  How is this sorted out in the configure?
   Buy using an autoconf macro AC_LIB_PREPARE_MULTILIB.  Where is this
   provided? In a recent version of gettext (more recent that fink
   currently provides).  So on every build system we have to get (e.g
   from the pre-build package e.g. Ubuntu intrepid) or downlaod and
   install gettext manually and point the autogen (that run aclocal and
   autoconf) to use the macros in the files installed from gettext.

   I wanted to check that the torsions in ligand conformation were
   being correctly set.  I needed a function therefore to return a
   torsion to the scripting level - given a set of atom specifiers.
   So first a wrote a test that tested that the torsion generation
   function worked - did it fail properly when the (some of) the atoms
   were not correctly specified (i.e. not in the molecule).  When that
   was working, I could write a test to do the ligand fitting and
   check the torsions of the best fitting (hopefully correctly
   fitting) model.

   Frank:

     This one is quicker: are you able to colour text in the Display
     Manager?  In which case it would be handy to have the text for
     the map objects coloured according to map type, e.g. blue for
     sigmaA map, red for difference map (info you can infer from the
     mtz?), and even green for other maps (usually
     experimental/averaged).

   Yes, except use the background color, I think.  And how about a

   JB et al:

   Copy fragment 2bz1 //B/1-305  -> no atoms selected

   Make the image type png

   Don't display bumps - in the environment distances (so that
   biologist see the hydrogen bonds - but not the bumps (the are not
   interested in them)).

   Unphosphorylate (change the residue type)

   Add a key binding to cut side chains (shift K, perhaps).

* Done.

   Perhaps the hydrogens on a ligand from probe is not working as
   you'd hoped.  Try with several different ligands.  See "Use
   write_connectivity to generate ligand hydrogens" in the rel-todo.

   Then you will need to use the hydrogen conn file when running
   reduce.

   It is reasonble for me to say he period is 0 and the sd is 0 on a
   rotatable bond.  So coot should deal with that.

      i.e. if the sd is 0, then no torsion restraint on that tor.
       also if the period is 0, there souold ben no torsion
       restraints.

   The weight matrix refinement control dialog needs to be read/set.

   We want button in the main toolbar to open a coordinaes file (so
   that we dont have to click and hold and select a menu item on the
   file men (Word does it).  Same for cif and mtz.  We need to make
   the open_coords_dialog() acceccesable from scripting.

   split residue (his) and rotamers (try both from CA, and all).

   Try rotamers on a alt confed residue.

   Delete a water (shift W).

   On adding a water, it defaults to adding to "Waters molecule" or
   something - stop doing that and if it is default/not assigned, then
   give me a dialog to assign it

   Somehow go to reside "GTY" (let me type a triple letter).

   The sequence alignement seems to fail, because lets say the protein
   starts with residue 11, the sequence alignemnt should be for the
   model, not the sequence.  Needs investigating.

   Residues with missing atoms: I want to use the . and , key on the
   generated list.

   Same goes for the list from Find Waters.  I want a list of waters
   in a dialog that I can use . and , with. Like questionable waters.

   Backrub rotamer search on a PHE in a helix.  -> terrible solution.
   Need to include clash terms.

   User-define-click resets the cursor after it has run the
   function. This can be inconvenient, when user-defined-click calls
   itself at the end (e.g. we don't know how many times
   user-defined-click needs to be called - so we use it in one-by-one
   mode)

   Try sphere refinement with hydrogens on. Check that convergence
   happens.

   "SSM all" to this: give me a dialog, with an "all on" button.

   chains ligands
   A        D
   B        E
   C        F

   SSM-all should copy across the ligands too - that is what we are
   most interested in. You will have to find which ligands should come
   with which chains.

   NCS ghosts don't work with ligands/cofacors.  Can you make it work
   with those too?

   There should be quick way to undo/undisplay "highight intereting
   residue"

   Make an uberfile with views, maps, proteinm models in it.

   align vs pir sequence failed to do anything obvious.
   We then dis alignment-mismatches-gui by hand and it gave us a gui.

   An "Insert residue" should take you to the nearest residue.

   But the residue number is wrong for insertions.
   Mutations look fine.

	Project student idea: In refining RNA, it would be nice to
	have extra restraints to keep the base planes aligned.  This
	could be done with a combination of angle and plane (pseudo)
	restraints as a mmCIF link.  Write a program to generate these
	from a PDB file.  You'll need a wiggle-room factor.  Maybe
	generate an intermediate representation/file that the user can
	optionally edit and generate the dictionary from that.

Garib: 08/01/09


  If top/par file could be converted to the following type of
  instructions then you do not need to define everything in cif file
  (these are for torsion angles, all other restraints can be defined
  similarly)

  General torsion angle restraints for any quartet of atoms:

  external torsion first chain [ch] residue [res] insertion [ins] atom
  [n] [altecode [a]] next chain [ch] residue [res] insertion [ins]
  atom [n] [altecode [a] ] [symm y/n] next chain [ch] residue [res]
  insertion [ins] atom [n] [altecode [a] ] next chain [ch] residue
  [res] insertion [ins] atom [n] [altecode [a] ]
 [symm y/n] value <v> sigma <s> period> <p>

  Exampl

  external torsion first chain A residue 220 atom C next chain A
  residue 220 atom CA next chain A residue 220 atom C next chain A
  residue 221 atom N value -60 sigma 10 period 1

   Ingo K: if you try to add a c-terminal residue, coot does recognize

   e.g. delete_atom_by_atom_index, delete_atom, delete_residue, we
   have:

   CResidue *residue_p =
      graphics_info_t::molecules[imol].get_residue(resno, ins_code, chain_id);
   if (residue_p) {
      coot::residue_spec_t spec(residue_p);
      g.delete_residue_from_geometry_graphs(imol, spec);
   }

   This needs to be rationalised into (perhaps)
   delete_residue_from_geometry_graphs_maybe(chain_id, resno, ins_code);

    An extension to backrub rotamer:

    For each rotamer: try chi-by-chi to improve the fit to the density
    of the side chain.  It will probably only need 2 rounds.  Needs
    non-trivial minimiser though (having said that, it's only a series
    of 1-d functions).

    score wil be relatively low and ignorable?

Ed Pozharski:

   Coot severely slows down the system when I try to generate the
   density fit graph using multi-model (NMR-style) pdb file.  First,
   it apparently generates as many dialogs as there are models, yet
   every graph has multiple bars (which is not very useful since they
   are overlapping).  Computer becomes unresponsive for some time, but
   when it comes back everything is very slow (except that I can
   rotate and zoom in smoothly, things get slow if I re-centre).

   The problem appears to be that coot eats a lot of RAM under these
   circumstances.  I have 4Gb here and it's still not enough so
   machine starts using the swap and thus gets very-very slow.
   Interestingly, most of the extra RAM is owned by Xorg, not coot,
   and is not freed even when I exit (but it is when I log out).

   If I load the same number of models as individual pdb-files, I can
   generate multiple density fit graphs with virtually undetectable
   increase in memory use.

     sqrt(sum(delta_rho2)/Npoints)/sigma(rho), where delta_rho is a
     grid-point value in a 2(mFo-DFc) map, the sum is over the region
     of interest (atom, residue, side-chain etc), Npoints is the
     number of grid points in the region, and sigma(rho) is the
     uncertainty in the density (which must be estimated for the
     asymmetric unit of the map, NOT just the region).  Note that it's
     equivalent to the negative log-likelihood, which IMO is the
     appropriate statistic for this situation, if it's assumed that
     the errors in the density have a normal distribution.

If that won't do, a trivial function to fix occs of given alt conf can
be made by wrapping set-atom-attributes

    Here is how to run molprobity probe for just the interactions of
    environment onto the ligand (and vica versa):

    (No internal interaction of ligand)

   Here residue 459 is the ligand:

   probe -u -both "459" "not 459" 2gpu-A459.pdb 2gpu-coot-0.pdb > probe.dots

   Do this after running reduce of course (so that the Hs are pointing
   in good directions).

  On pressing Esc during refinement:

	Can we have a dialog box pop up summarizing the geometry and
	asking us to accept/reject instead of reverting back?
	Sometimes a real space refine takes too long/gets lost when
	the best fit to the density is observed before that happens.

   How about this: map the surface of a protein onto a cylinder,

   Then unwrap the cylinder and display as a 2d plot.

   Do that for both sides of an interface.

   or mutant vs native.

   so we will need some way to mark the surface of atom selection.

    after changing the interface, e.g. c-interface.h

    you will probably need to do:
    an install in scheme
    an install in python
    run swig to make new coot.py
    an install in src, to update installed coot.py

    Mutate and autofit to an MSE should change the atoms to HETATM,
    but it does not.

    So, minimol's atom class needs 'bool is_hetatm' flag.

    Import: minimol's residue constructors from CResidue * need to set
    the is_hetatm flag by testing at->Het.

    Extraction: When constructing the pcmmdbmanager(), we need to set
    at->Het = true when making the CAtom *.

   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16659781/memory-leaks-in-gtk-hello-world-program

   For debugging glib/gtk programs I would use this command:

   G_SLICE=debug-blocks valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full <gtk program>
   G_SLICE=debug-blocks will turn off gtk's advanced memory management to allow valgrind to show correct results.
   --leak-check=full will show stack traces for the leaked memory blocks.

   You can also use --show-reachable=yes to see stack traces for all
   memory blocks that haven't been free when the program exits.

   There is also the massif valgrind tool that tracks memory usage to
   show which parts of the program are using the most memory.

   Run program under massif:

   G_SLICE=always-malloc valgrind --tool=massif --detailed-freq=2 --max-snapshots=400 --num-callers=20 <gtk program>

  How about a ring flip function where you identify an atom in a ring,
  it checks that there are less than 3 connections to the ring, then
  rotates 180 about one of the connecting bonds (the one with the
  largest number of atoms in the fragment) and back-rotates the
  other torsion (if exists), choosing and torsion that minimizes the
  movement of the atoms.

   Find areas of a map that should have model but do not:

   o make a partial model, run refmac, make a map, low res filter it,
     mask out the protein parts that we have, fill big blobs with dummy atoms - zero occ
     (these should be added to the partial model for sending back to
     refmac).  Make dummy atoms 1.5A apart.

   -> resulting map should have better density for the missing domain.  Does it?

   non-Pro cis-peptides

     why is cis-Pro so much more common than non-cis Pro?

   non-Pro cis-peptides in structures

     1) "if you don't know what a cis-peptide is and don't care to
        find out when Coot tells you that you've introduced one, then on
        your own head be it - there is a validation tool that will navigate
	you to all the cis-peptides in your structure should you care to
	press the button. Validations tests won't help you if you choose
	not to run them."

     2) ... but there was a bug ... as I was writing the code and
     testing it, I could see that there was a danger of flipping the N
     to the same (of the CA-CA vector) side as the CO and then coot
     would happily use plane restraint minimization to create a
     cis-peptide... so I tried to make this less probable by
     introducing a non-linearity term so that the atoms further from
     the pull point are pulled less than their linear fraction (by
     raising a fraction to a power). Unfortunately I made an
     arithmetic error which meant that I had made such pull
     transformations *more* likely than less.

     October 2014 I heard Jane Richardson discuss the problem and
     reviewed, fixed the problem that afternoon.

     Given that several papers have recently (now) been published about
     non-Pro cis-peptides in the PDB, it seems that my expectation of
     skill had not been met in large part and it necessary for me to
     rework the interface to remove the possibility unitentional
     creation of non-Pro cis-peptides during refinement.

  trans-restraints:

     what's trans, cis? draw arrows to mid-line.  Why is this
     restraint necessary (because user can create non-local changes
     that have large energy difference (and accidentally create a
     peptide with and omega of 89 degress)).

     how does this help refinement?  Before and after video?

     Quickly estimate B-factor of atoms:

     Using PDB data, do a plot of density vs radius for atoms at various
     resolutions so that

     rpo(r) -> resolution

     Compare that with what we have in a fragment model.

   Creating boost::python::object from PyObject*

   When you want a boost::python::object to manage a pointer to
   PyObject* pyobj one does:

   boost::python::object o(boost::python::handle<>(pyobj)); In this
   case, the object, manages the pyobj, it won't increase the
   reference count on construction.

    Otherwise, to use a borrowed reference:

    boost::python::object
    boost::python::handle<>(boost::python::borrowed(pyobj)));
    In this case, Py_INCREF is called, so pyobj is not destructed when
    object goes out of scope.

   o Can you find some "negatively" scoring parts of a domain for jiggle fitting?
     Make n test points inside the domain box and iterate moving them away from the
     closest atom of the protein.  Make a chain of test points so that you can use
     SeekContacts - use a distance that is more than the maximum distance a
     test point will move (n_iter * step size). Atoms that move away from more than
     one atom are interesting (probably). Test points will drift away on the outside.
     So only keep those points that are within xA of any atom.

     Use generic display objects.

  gettext problems in cj build gtkglext (glib)

  configuration of glib failed because it couldn't find gettext (perhaps msgfmt, actually)
  That was because cj build didn't install the msgfmt file.

  The solution was to put the directory for msgfmt in the path before running cj (and that
  directory was provided by homebrew).

  A better solution is for cj to install msgfmt and put the directory into which it installs
  it into the path itself.

    This tells readline that it can find the termcap library functions

    termcap library.  Readline uses the termcap functions, but does not
    link with the termcap or curses library itself, allowing applications
    which link with readline the to choose an appropriate library.
    This option tells readline to link the example programs with the

    ERRAT notes and improvement:

    https://yeateslab.mbi.ucla.edu/structure-validation/

    One weakness of the program was a high sensitivity to small
    deviations in atomic positions, owing mainly to the discontinuous
    nature of the error function arising from the distance
    cutoff. Around 2002, another undergraduate student Dennis Obukov,
    rewrote ERRAT with a continuous distance weighting scheme, which
    led to more stable and robust behavior.

Thanks to Takanori and Charles for the hints and prompts. You have
brought 3 days of confusion and frustration to an end.

The answer (or current fix) is

export GI_TYPELIB_PATH /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/girepository-1.0

so that the gobject that I compiled uses the system girepository
also. And that's where Gtk+3 lives.

It might be possible to properly populate that directory at
compile/installation time and so the env var would not be needed (that
would be my preferred solution). But this is certainly good enough for
now.

   convert gtk2 glade to gtk3 glade:

   Seems that its easy enough - at least for one file that I have tried:
   Replace the <glade-interface> tag with <interface> and replace all "widget
   class=" statements with "object class=". Glade 3 seems to read the edited file
   and even fix some discrepancies. Saving the file converts it to glade 3 format,
   which should be compatible with GTK+-3, I hope. It will take a lot more work to
   migrate the application source, before I find out ;-)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14346090/importerror-no-module-named-backend-gdk

In addition to Haldean Brown's answer, note that if you really need to use pip you can force it to
recompile matplotlib locally and get "the deep magic that setup.py does" with the --no-binary option:

pip uninstall matplotlib
pip install matplotlib --no-binary=matplotlib

As you want to use the GTKAgg backend, Using pip may prove useful in the future to freeze matplotlib
 at a version where it is supported (the deprecation warning states it will be dropped in 3.0):

pip install matplotlib==2.2.2 --no-binary=matplotlib

Different genomes have been sequenced by different institutes with
different motivations and interests. As such there is no single site
where you can find all the genome information that you may want.

Thus said the NCBI is a good place to start as they curate GenBank
database whose contents get mirrored and exchanged with other
meta-genomic warehouses such as EMBL and DDBJ.

Please have a look at this as well
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/genome and this to download genome
data for various organisms. ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/

   to add a dialog that uses response_id:
   When you add the buttons, don't give them callback in Signals, *do* give them a Response ID in General.

   See add_reps_dialog, but note that "Close" button is a Response, not connected to
   on_add_reps_dialog_response_gtkbuilder_callback() (I am not sure how to activeate that callback).

   Here's how to do a modern python Gtk molecule combobox

    combobox = Gtk.ComboBox()
    combobox_mol_items = make_store_for_model_molecule_combobox()
    combobox.set_model(combobox_mol_items)
    renderer_text = Gtk.CellRendererText()
    combobox.pack_start(renderer_text, True)
    combobox.add_attribute(renderer_text, "text", 1)
    combobox.set_active(0) # or whatever

    When the gui/dialog is read, use this:

    def get_molecule():
        tree_iter = combobox_molecule.get_active_iter()
        imol = -1
        if tree_iter is not None:
            model = combobox_molecule.get_model()
            it = model[tree_iter]
            imol = it[0]
        return imol

old style function (as a executable string)

        func = "go_to_view_number(" + str(button_number) + ",0)" 20211115-PE no to string functions
        buttons.append([button_label, func, desciption])

so try this:

        func = lambda w : coot.go_to_view_number(button_number, 0)
        buttons.append([button_label, func, desciption])

Doesn't work because button_number is not captured. We need a generator

    def generator(button_number):
        func = lambda button_number_c=button_number : coot.go_to_view_number(button_number_c, 0)
        def action(arg):
            print("debug in action() arg is", arg, "button_number is", button_number)
            func(button_number)
        return action

   ...
        func = generator(button_number)
        buttons.append([button_label, func, desciption])


  maybe this could be made more compact.

        info_dialog("No bad puckers.")
    else:
        buttons = []
        for residue in residue_list:
            residue_spec = residue[1]
            pucker_atom = residue[0]
            at_name = get_ribose_residue_atom_name(imol, residue_spec, pucker_atom)
            ls = [residue_spec[0] + " " + str(residue_spec[1]) + residue_spec[2] + \
                  ": " + residue[2],
                  ["set_go_to_atom_molecule("+ str(imol) +")",
                   "set_go_to_atom_chain_residue_atom_name(" +\
                   "\"" + str(residue_spec[0]) + "\", " +\
                   str(residue_spec[1]) + ", " +\
                   "\"" + str(at_name) + "\")"]
                  ]
            buttons.append(ls)
        dialog_box_of_buttons("Non-pukka puckers",

                              "  Close  ")

Now:

    def go(imol, residue_spec, at_name):
        ch_id = residue_spec_to_chain_id(residue_spec)
        res_no = residue_spec_to_res_no(residue_spec)
        coot.set_go_to_atom_molecule(imol)
        coot.set_go_to_atom_chain_residue_atom_name(ch_id, res_no, at_name)

    def generator(imol, residue_spec, at_name):
        func = lambda imol_c = imol, residue_spec_c = residue_spec, at_name_c = at_name : go(imol_c, residue_spec_c, at_name_c)
        def action(arg):
            func(imol, residue_spec, at_name)
        return action

    if len(residue_list) == 0:

    else:
        buttons = []
        for residue in residue_list:

   New Style combobox

   GtkWidget *model_combobox = widget_from_builder("generate_diff_map_peaks_molecule_combobox");
   GtkWidget   *map_combobox = widget_from_builder("generate_diff_map_peaks_map_combobox");

   auto get_model_molecule_vector = [] () {
                                     graphics_info_t g;
                                     std::vector<int> vec;
                                     int n_mol = g.n_molecules();
                                     for (int i=0; i<n_mol; i++)
                                        if (g.is_valid_model_molecule(i))
                                           vec.push_back(i);
                                     return vec;
                                  };

   graphics_info_t g;
   int imol_active = -1;
   GCallback func_combobox_changed = G_CALLBACK(nullptr); // we don't care until this dialog is read
   auto model_list = get_model_molecule_vector();
   g.fill_combobox_with_molecule_options(model_combobox, func, imol_active, model_list);

   if func_combobox_changed is needed for direct action, the signature is:
   void func_combobox_changed(GtkWidget *combobox, gpointer data);

Here is how you read the imol:

   int imol_coords = my_combobox_get_imol(GTK_COMBO_BOX(model_combobox));
   int imol_map    = my_combobox_get_imol(GTK_COMBO_BOX(map_combobox));

## --- Widgets that have changed in GTK ---

 - Padding is gone, margins and layout are in.
 - Tables are out, Grids are in.
 - Radio buttons are gone, use check buttons instead.
 - HBoxes and VBoxes are gone, use generic Box
 - Toolbuttons, Toolcheckbutton, tooltogglebuttons are gone, use the non-tool version
 - Canvas is gone, use widget lists instead (how?)

Have a look at adding thing this:
<style>
   <class name="suggested-action"/>
</style>
after a buttons's properties
Here are other styles:

    .image-button: used when the button contains only an image
    .text-button: used when the button contains only a label
    .flat: used for buttons with no border or background
    .keyboard-activating: used when the button is activated by keyboard input
    .suggested-action: used for buttons that are recommended or suggested actions
    .destructive-action: used for buttons that perform a destructive action, such as deleting data
    .circular: used for circular buttons

From phind.com, Sound on a Mac:


FILE* file = fopen("path_to_your_file.ogg", "rb");
OggVorbis_File vf;
ov_open(file, &vf, NULL, 0);

    Decode the audio data: Use libogg to decode the audio data. This
    will convert the raw audio data into a format that can be played
    by the Audio Queue Services API:

vorbis_info* vi = ov_info(&vf, -1);

    Set up the Audio Queue: Use the Audio Queue Services API to set up
    an audio queue. This will be used to play the decoded audio data:

AudioQueueRef queue;
AudioQueueNewOutput(&format, AudioCallback, this, NULL, 0, &queue);

    Play the audio data: Use the Audio Queue Services API to play the
    decoded audio data:

AudioQueueStart(queue, NULL);

    Clean up: When you're done playing the audio data, make sure to
    clean up by closing the .ogg file and freeing any resources that
    were allocated:

ov_clear(&vf);
fclose(file);

   o The button to invoke this is in a module?
      - Look in python/coot_gui.py for neighboring menu item
      - Add a add_action() line
      - Add a wrapper and the function it wraps
     else
      - add your action to create-menu-item-actions.cc
   o Add a coot api function that is called by the function
     e.g. display the new dialog, which fills the entries
          and comboboxes.

     Use
     g.new_fill_combobox_with_coordinates_options(combobox_2, callback, imol_active);
     fill_combobox_with_map_options(combobox_1, callback);

   o The response handler, on_new_function_dialog_response() is

   map_partition_by_chain_threaded() is a good example of non-blocking
   map generation. It creates a detacted thread and a callback to look
   for the results of the thread. The results are stored in graphics_info_t.

   In this case the selector is a dialog, it should be, for such a small
   interface, a main-window overlay.

   see commit 0cf8c4679a84a6dd4f51011c49bbc489ad2cba83
