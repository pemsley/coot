@node What is Coot?
@section What is Coot?

Coot is a molecular graphics application. Its primary focus is
crystallographic macromolecular model-building and manipulation rather
than representation @emph{i.e.} more like Frodo than Rasmol.
@c @cindex{Rasmol}.  
Having said that, Coot can work with small molecule (SHELXL) and electron
microscopy data, be used for homology modelling, make passably pretty
pictures and display NMR structures.

Coot is Free Software.  You can give it away. If you don't like the way
it behaves, you can fix it yourself.

@node What Coot is Not
@section What Coot is Not

Coot is not:

@itemize

@item CCP4's official Molecular Graphics program @footnote{
    The official CCP4 graphics program (which contains parts of Coot
    (and Coot contains parts of CCP4MG)), CCP4MG is under the
    direct control of Liz Potterton and Stuart McNicholas.}

@item a program to do refinement @footnote{although it does have a
    local refinement algorithm it is no substitute for refmac
    (a wrapper for refmac is available).}

@item a protein crystallographic suite@footnote{that's the job of the
     CCP4 Program Suite.}.

@end itemize

@node Hardware Requirements
@section Hardware Requirements

The code is designed to be portable to any Unix-like operating system.
Coot certainly runs on RedHat Linux of various sorts, Fedora, Ubuntu,
Debian, SuSe Linux and MacOS X.  There is also a Window port (called
WinCoot).

@c @footnote{including Cygwin, but currently coot is ``unstable'' on a Cygwin system.}.  

If you want to port to some other operating system, you are welcome
@footnote{it's Free Software after all and I could give you a
  hand.}.  Note that your task will be eased by using GNU GCC to compile
the programs components.

@subsection Mouse
@cindex mouse
Coot works best with a 3-button mouse and works better if
it has a scroll-wheel too (see Chapter 2 for more details) @footnote{I
  can get by with a one button Macintosh - but it's not ideal.}.

@node Environment Variables
@section Environment Variables
Coot responds to several environment variables that modify its
behaviour.

@itemize
@item @env{COOT_STANDARD_RESIDUES} 
  The filename of the pdb file
  containing the standard amino acid residues in ``standard
  conformation'' @footnote{as it is known in Clipper.}
@item @env{COOT_SCHEME_DIR} 
  The directory containing standard (part of the distribution) scheme
  files 
@item @env{COOT_SCHEME_EXTRAS_DIR} 
  A ':'-separated list of directories containing bespoke scheme files.
  This variable is not set by default.  If you set it, Coot will test
  each ':'-separated string that it points to a directory, and if it does, 
  Coot will load all the @t{.scm} files in that directory.
@item @env{COOT_PYTHON_EXTRAS_DIR} 
  A ':'-separated list of directories containing bespoke python files.
  This variable is not set by default.  If you set it, Coot will test
  each ':'-separated string that it points to a directory, and if it does, 
  Coot will load all the @t{.py} files in that directory.
@item @env{COOT_REF_STRUCTS} 
  The directory containing a set of high resolution pdb files used as 
@cindex reference structures
  reference structures to build backbone atoms from
  C@math{\alpha} positions
@item @env{COOT_REF_SEC_STRUCTS} 
  The directory containing a set of high-quality structures to be used
  as templates for fitting beta strands.  If this is not set, then the
  directory COOT_REF_SEC_STRUCTS will be used to find the reference pdb
  files.  
@item @env{COOT_REFMAC_LIB_DIR} 
@cindex dictionary, cif 
  Refmac's CIF directory containing the monomers and link descriptions.
  In the future this may simply be the same directory in which refmac
  looks to find the library dictionary.
@item @env{COOT_SBASE_DIR} 
@cindex dictionary, ligands
  The directory to find the SBASE dictionary (often comes with CCP4).
@item @env{COOT_RESOURCES_DIR} 
  The directory that contains the
  splash screen image and the GTK+ application resources.
@item @env{COOT_BACKUP_DIR} 
  The directory to which backup are
  written (if it exists as a directory).  If it is not, then backups
  are written to the current directory (the directory in which coot
  was started).
@end itemize
  
And of course extension language environment variables are used too:

@itemize
@item @env{PYTHONPATH} (for python modules)
@item @env{GUILE_LOAD_PATH} (for guile modules)
@end itemize

Normally, these environment variables will be set correctly in the coot
shell script.

@node Command Line Arguments
@section Command Line Arguments
@cindex command line arguments 
Rather that using the GUI to read in information, you can use the
following command line arguments:
@itemize
@item @code{--c @emph{cmd}} to run a command @code{@emph{cmd}} on start up
@item @code{--script @emph{filename}} to run a script on start up (but see Section @ref{Scripting})
@item @code{--no-state-script} don't run the @t{0-coot.state.scm} script on start up.  
   Don't save a state script on exit either.
@item @code{--pdb @emph{filename}}  for pdb/coordinates file
@item @code{--coords @emph{filename}}  for SHELX .ins/.res and CIF files
@item @code{--data @emph{filename}} for mtz, phs or mmCIF data file
@item @code{--auto @emph{filename}} for auto-reading mtz files (mtz file has the default labels FWT, PHWT)
@item @code{--map @emph{filename}}  for a map (currently CCP4-format only)
@item @code{--dictionary @emph{filename}} read in a cif monomer dictionary 
@item @code{--help} print command line options
@item @code{--stereo} start up in hardware stereo mode
@item @code{--version} print the version of coot and exit
@item @code{--code @emph{accession-code}} on starting Coot, get the pdb file 
   and mtz file (if it exists) from the EDS
@item @code{--no-guano} don't leave ``Coot droppings'' i.e. don't write state
    and history files on exit
@item @code{--side-by-side} start in side-by-side stereo mode
@item @code{--update-self} command-line mode to update the coot to the latest 
    pre-release on the server
@item @code{--python} an argument with no parameters - used to tell Coot that 
    the -c arguments should be process as python (rather than as scheme).
@item @code{--small-screen} start with smaller icons and font to fit on small
    screen displays
@item @code{--zalman-stereo} start in Zalman stereo mode
@end itemize

So, for example, one might use:
@itemize
@item @code{coot --pdb post-refinement.pdb --auto refmac-2.mtz --dictionary lig.cif}
@end itemize

@node Web Page
@section Web Page
@cindex web page
Coot has a web page:

@itemize
@item @url{http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/}
@end itemize

There you can read more about the CCP4 molecular graphics project in
general and other projects which are important for Coot @footnote{coot
  has several influences and dependencies, but these will not be
  discussed here in the User Manual.}.

@node Crash
@section Crash
@cindex crash
Coot might crash on you - it shouldn't.  

@cindex recover session
@cindex crash recovery
Whenever Coot manipulates the model, it saves a backup pdb file.
There are backup files in
the directory @t{coot-backup} @footnote{COOT_BACKUP_DIR is used
  in preference if set}. You can recover the session (until the last
edit) by reading in the pdb file that you started with last time and
then use @command{File -> Recover Session@dots{}}.

I would like to know about coot crashing @footnote{The map-reading
  problem (documented in Section @ref{Maps in General}) is already
  known.} so that I can fix it as soon as possible. If you want your
problem fixed, this involves some work on your part sadly.

First please make sure that you are using the most recent version of
coot.  I will often need to know as much as possible about what you did
to cause the bug.  If you can reproduce the bug and send me the files
that are needed to cause it, I can almost certainly fix it @footnote{now
there's a hostage to fortune.} - especially if you
@cindex debugger 
@cindex gdb
use the debugger (gdb) and send a backtrace
too@footnote{to do so, please send me the output of the following:
  @t{$ gdb `which coot-real` @emph{corefile}} and then at the
  @t{(gdb)} prompt type: @command{where}, where
  @t{@emph{corefile}} is the core dump file, @file{core} or
  @file{core.4536} or some such.}.  Note that you may have to source the
  contents of @t{bin/coot} so that the libraries are can be found when
  the executable dynamically links.

@section Scrollwheel
When there is no map, using the scroll-wheel has no effect.  If there
is exactly one map displayed, 
@cindex contouring, map
@cindex scroll, map contour change by
@cindex map scrolling
@cindex scroll-wheel
the scroll-wheel
will change the contour level of that map.  If there are two or more
maps, the map for which the contour level is changed can be set using either 
@command{HID -> Scrollwheel -> Attach scroll-wheel
  to which map?} and selecting a map number or clicking the "Scroll"
  radio button for the map in the Display Manager.

You can turn off the map contour level changing by the scroll wheel using:

@code{(set-scroll-by-wheel-mouse 0)}

(the default is 1 [on]).

@node Selecting Atoms
@section Selecting Atoms
Several Coot functions require the selecting of atoms to specify a
residue range (for example: Regularize, Refine (Section
@ref{Regularization and Real Space Refinement}) or Rigid Body Fit Zone (Section
@ref{Rigid Body Refinement})).  Select atoms with the Left-mouse.
See also Picking (Section @ref{sec_picking}).

Use the scripting function
@c @cindex{quanta-buttons}
@code{(quanta-buttons)} to make the mouse
functions more like other molecular graphics programs to which you may
be more accustomed @footnote{See also @ref{more on zooming}}.

@node Virtual Trackball
@section Virtual Trackball
@cindex trackball, virtual
You may not completely like the way the
molecule is moved by the mouse movement @footnote{Mouse movement in
  ``Spherical Surface'' mode generates a component of (often
  undesirable) screen z-rotation, particularly noticeable when the
  mouse is at the edge of the screen.}.  To change this, try:
@command{HID -> Virtual Trackball -> Flat}.  To
do this from the scripting interface: @code{(vt-surface
  1)} @footnote{@code{(vt-surface 0)} to turn it back to ``Spherical''
  mode.}.

If you @emph{do} want @command{screen-z rotation}
@cindex z-rotation 
screen-z rotation, you can either use Shift Right-Mouse Drag or set
the Virtual Trackball to Spherical Surface mode and move the mouse
along the bottom edge of the screen.


@node more on zooming
@section More on Zooming
The function @code{(quanta-like-zoom)} adds the ability to zoom the
view using just Shift + Mouse movement @footnote{this is off by default
  because I find it annoying.}.

There is also a Zoom slider
@cindex zoom, slider
(@command{Draw -> Zoom}) for those without a right-mouse button.

@section Version number
@cindex version number 

The version number of Coot can be found at the top of the ``About''
window (@command{Help -> About}).

This will return the version of coot:

@code{$ coot --version}

There is also a script function to return the version of coot:

@code{(coot-version)}

@node Antialiasing
@section Antialiasing

The built-in antialiasing (for what it's worth) can be enabled using:

@code{(set-do-anti-aliasing 1)}

The default is @code{0} (off).

This can also be activated using @command{Edit Preferences -> Others ->
Antialiasing -> Yes}.

If you have an nVidia graphics card, external antialiasing can be
actived setting the environment variable @t{__GL_FSAA_MODE}.  For me a
setting of @t{5} works nicely and gives a better image than using
Coot's built-in antialiasing.


Also for nVidia graphics card users, there is the application
nvidia-settings: 

@command{Antialiasing Setting -> Override Application Settings} and
slide the slider to the right. On restarting Coot, it should be in
antialias mode @footnote{that works for me, at least.}.

@node Molecule Number
@section Molecule Number
@cindex molecule number 
Coot is based on the concept of molecules.  Maps and coordinates are
different representations of molecules.  The access to the molecule is
@emph{via} the @emph{molecule number}.  It is often important therefore to
know the molecule number of a particular molecule.

The Molecule Number of a molecule can be found by clicking on an atom of
that molecule (if it has coordinates of course). The first number in
brackets in the resulting text in the status bar and console is the
Molecule Number.  The Molecule Number can also be found in Display
Control window (Section @ref{Display Manager}).  It is also displayed on
the left-hand side of the molecule name in the option menus of the
``Save Coordinates'' and ``Go To Atom'' windows.

@node Display Issues
@section Display Issues
The ``graphics'' window is drawn using 
@cindex OpenGL
OpenGL.  It is considerably smoother (i.e. more frames/sec) when using a
3D accelerated X server.

The view is orthographic (@emph{i.e.} the back is the same size as the
front).  The default clipping is about right for viewing coordinate
data, but is often a little too ``thick'' for viewing electron
density.  It is easily changed (see Section @ref{Clipping Manipulation}).

Depth-cueing
@cindex depth-cueing 
is linear and fixed on.

The graphics window can be resized, but it has a minimum size of
400x400 pixels.

@subsection Stereo
Hardware Stereo is an option for Coot (@command{Draw -> Stereo@dots{} ->
Hardware Stereo -> OK}), side-by-side stereo is not an option.

The angle between the stereo pairs (the stereo separation) can be
changed to suit your personal tastes using:

@code{(set-hardware-stereo-angle-factor @emph{angle-factor})}

where @code{@emph{angle-factor}} would typically be between 1.0 and 2.0

@subsection Pick Cursor
When asked to pick a residue or atom, the cursor changes from the normal
arrow shape to a "pick" cursor.  Sometimes it is difficult to see the
default pick cursor, so you can change it using the function

@code{(set-pick-cursor-index @emph{i})}

where @code{@emph{i}} is an integer less than 256.  The cursors can be
viewed using an external X program:

@code{xfd -fn cursor}


@subsection Origin Marker

A yellow box
@cindex yellow box
 called the ``origin
marker''
@cindex origin marker
 marks the origin.  It can be removed using:

@code{(set-show-origin-marker 0)}

Its state can be queried like this:

@code{(show-origin-marker-state)}

which returns an number (0 if it is not displayed, 1 if it is).

A simple screenshot (image dump) can be made using @command{Draw ->

only get the left-hand image.


@node Raster3D
@section Raster3D output
Output suitable for use by Raster3D's
@cindex Raster3D
``render''
@cindex render
can be generated using the scripting function

@code{(raster3d @emph{file-name})}

where @code{@emph{file-name}} is such as @code{"test.r3d"}
@footnote{Povray support is only semi-working, there is a problem
 with the orientation of the image.}.

There is a keyboard key to generate this file, run ``render'' and
display the image: Function key F8.

You can also use the function

@code{(render-image)}

which will create a file @file{coot.r3d}, from which ``render'' produces
@file{coot.png}. This png file is displayed using ImageMagick's display
program (by default).  Use something like:

@code{(set! coot-png-display-program "gqview")}

to change that to different display program ("gqview" in this case).

@code{(set! coot-png-display-program "open")} 

would use Preview (by default) on Macintosh.
@c thanks for that info Bill Scott.

To change the widths of the bonds and density ``lines'' use (for example):

@code{(set-raster3d-bond-thickness 0.1)}

and 

@code{(set-raster3d-density-thickness 0.01)}

Similarly for bones:

@code{(set-raster3d-bone-thickness 0.05)}


To turn off the representations of the atoms (spheres):

@code{(set-renderer-show-atoms 0)}


@node Display Manager
@section Display Manager
@cindex Display Manager
This is also known as ``Map and molecule
(coordinates) display control''.  Here you can select which maps and
molecules you can see and how they are drawn @footnote{to a limited
  extent.}.  The ``Display'' and ``Active'' are toggle buttons, either
depressed (active) or undepressed (inactive).  The ``Display'' buttons
control whether a molecule (or map) is drawn and the ``Active'' button
controls if the molecule is clickable @footnote{the substantial
  majority of the time you will want your the buttons to be both
  either depressed or undepressed, rarely one but not the other.}
(@emph{i.e.} if the molecule's atoms can be labeled).

@cindex Scroll
The "Scroll" radio buttons sets which map is has its contour level
changed by scrolling the mouse scroll wheel.

By default, the path names of the files are not displayed in the
Display Manager.  To turn them on:

@code{(set-show-paths-in-display-manager 1)}

@cindex colour by chain
@cindex atom colouring
If you pull across the
horizontal scrollbar in a Molecule view, you will see the ``Render
as'' menu.  You can use this to change between normal ``Bonds (Colour
by Atom)'',``Bonds (Colour by Chain)'' and ``C@math{\alpha}''
representation
@cindex C@math{\alpha} representation
There is also
available ``No Waters'' and ``C@math{\alpha} + ligands'' representations.


@node The Modelling Toolbar
@section The Modelling Toolbar
@cindex modelling toolbar

You might not want to have the right-hand-side vertical toolbar that
contains icons for some modelling operations @footnote{British
modelling, of course} displayed:

@code{(hide-modelling-toolbar)}

to bring it back again:

@code{(show-modelling-toolbar)}



@node    The file selector
@section The file selector
@subsection File-name Filtering
@cindex file-name filtering
The ``Filter'' button in the fileselection
filters the filenames according to extension.  For coordinates files
the extensions are ``.pdb'' ``.brk'' ``.mmcif'' and others.  For data:
``.mtz'', ``.hkl'', ``.phs'', ``.cif'' and for (CCP4) maps ``.ext'',
``.msk'' and ``.map''.  If you want to add to the extensions, the
following functions are available:

@itemize 
@item @code{(add-coordinates-glob-extension @emph{extension})}
@item @code{(add-data-glob-extension @emph{extension})}
@item @code{(add-map-glob-extension @emph{extension})}
@item @code{(add-dictionary-glob-extension @emph{extension})}
@end itemize
where @code{@emph{extension}} is something like: @code{".mycif"}.

If you want the fileselection to be filtered without having to use the
"Filter" button, use the scripting function

@code{(set-filter-fileselection-filenames 1)}

@subsection Filename Sorting
If you like your files initially sorted by date (rather than
lexicographically, which is the default) use:

@code{(set-sticky-sort-by-date)}

@c this should be a GUI option.
@subsection Save Coordinates Directory
@cindex save coordinates directory
@cindex directory for save coordinates

Some people prefer that the fileselection for saving coordinates starts
in the original directory (rather than the directory from which they
last imported coordinates).  This option is for them:

@code{(set-save-coordinates-in-original-directory 1)}


@node    Scripting
@section Scripting
@cindex  scripting

@menu
* Python::
* Scheme::
* Coot State::
* Key Binding::
* User-Defined Functions::
@end menu

There is an compile-time option of adding a script interpreter.
Currently the options are python and guile.  It seems possible that in
future you will be able to use both in the same executable.  The binary
distribution of Coot are linked with guile, others with python.

Hundreds of commands are made available for use in scripting by using
SWIG, some of which are documented here. Other functions documented less
well, but descriptions for them can be found at the end of this manual.

Commands described throughout this manual (such as @code{(vt-surface
  1))} can be evaluated
@cindex executing commands
directly by Coot by using the ``Scripting Window'' (@command{Calculate
-> Scripting@dots{}}). Note that you type the commands in the upper
entry widget and the command gets echoed (in red) and the return value
and any output is displayed in the text widget lower (green).  The typed
command should be terminated with a carriage return @footnote{which
causes the evaluation of the command.}.  Files @footnote{such as the Coot
state file (Section @ref{Coot State}).} can be evaluated (executed)
using @command{Calculate -> Run Script@dots{}}.  

Note that in scheme (the usual scripting language of Coot), the
parentheses are important.

To execute a script file from the command line use the @code{--script
@emph{filename}} arguments 
@c % this seems not to be the case (any more), --script works 
@c % fine with --no-graphics
(except when also using the command line
argument @code{--no-graphics}, in which case you should use @code{-s
@emph{filename}}).

After you have used the scripting window, you may have noticed that you
can no longer kill Coot by using Ctrl-C in the console.  To recover this
ability:

@code{(exit)}

in the scripting window.

@node       Python
@subsection Python
@cindex python

@menu
 * Python Commands
@end menu

Coot has an (optional) embedded python interpreter.
Thus the full power of python is available to you.  Coot will look for
an initialization script 
@cindex startup settings (python)
@cindex @code{.coot.py}
(@code{$HOME/.coot.py}) and
will execute it if found.  This file should contain python commands
that set your personal preferences.


@subsubsection Python Commands
The scripting functions described in this manual are formatted
suitable for use with guile, @emph{i.e.}:

@code{(@emph{function} @emph{arg1} @emph{arg2@dots{}})}

If you are using Python instead: the format needs to be changed to:

@code{@emph{function}(@emph{arg1},@emph{arg2@dots{}})}

Note that dashes in guile function names become underscores for
python, so that (for example) @code{(raster-screen-shot)} becomes
@code{raster_screen_shot()}.


@c --------------------------------------------------------
@node       Scheme

@cindex initialization file
The scheme interpreter is made available by embedding
guile.  The initialization script used by this interpreter is
@cindex startup settings (scheme)

set your personal preferences.

@c --------------------------------------------------------
@node       Coot State
@c --------------------------------------------------------
@subsection Coot State
The ``state''
@cindex state
of Coot is saved on Exit and written to a
file called @code{0-coot.state.scm} (scheme)
@code{0-coot.state.py} (python).   This
state file contains information about the screen centre, the
clipping, colour map rotation size, the symmetry radius, and other
molecule related parameters such as filename, column labels,
coordinate filename @emph{etc.}.

Use @command{Calculate -> Run Script@dots{}} to use this file
to re-create the loaded maps and models that you had when you finished
using Coot @footnote{in that particular directory.} last time.
A state file can be saved at any time using @code{(save-state)}
which saves to file @code{0-coot.state.scm} or
@code{(save-state-filename "thing.scm")} which saves to file
@code{thing.scm}.

When Coot starts it can optionally run the commands in
@code{0-coot.state.scm}.  

Use @code{(set-run-state-file-status i)}
to change the behaviour: @code{i} is @code{0} to never run this
state file at 
@cindex startup dialog (state)
startup, @code{i} is
@code{1} to get a dialog option (this is the default) and @code{i}
is @code{2} to run the commands without question.

@c --------------------------------------------------------
@node       Key Binding
@c --------------------------------------------------------
@subsection Key Binding

``Power users'' of Coot might like to write their own functions and bind
that function to a keyboard key.  How do they do that?

By using the add-key-binding function:

@code{(add-key-binding @emph{function-name key function})}

where @code{@emph{key}} is a quoted string (note that upper case and
lower case keys are distinguished - activate get upper case key binding
you need to chord the shift key @footnote{funny that}).

for example:

@code{(add-key-binding "Refine Active Residue with Auto-accept" "x" refine-active-residue)}
 
Have a look at the key bindings section on the Coot wiki for several
more examples.

@c --------------------------------------------------------
@node       User-Defined Functions
@c --------------------------------------------------------
@subsection User-Defined Functions

``Power users'' of Coot might also like to write their own functions
that occur after picking an atom (or a number of atoms)

@code{(user-defined-click @emph{n_clicks} @emph{udfunc})}

define a function @code{@emph{func}} which runs after the user has
made @code{@emph{n_clicked}} atom picks.  @code{@emph{func}} is called
with a list of atom specifiers - the first member of which is the
molecule number.


@c --------------------------------------------------------
@node Backups and Undo
@c --------------------------------------------------------
@section Backups and Undo
@cindex backups
@cindex undo

@menu
 * Redo::
 * Restoring from Backup::
@end menu

By default, each time a modification is made to a model, the old
coordinates are written out @footnote{this might be initially surprising
since this could chew up a lot of disk space.  However, disk space is
cheap compared to losing you molecule.}.  The backups are kept in a
backup directory and are tagged with the date and the history number
(lower numbers are more ancient @footnote{The coordinates are written in
pdb format - that's OK, isn't it?.}).  The ``Undo'' function discards
the current molecule and loads itself from the most recent backup
coordinates.  Thus you do not have to remember to ``Save Changes'' -
coot will do it for you @footnote{unless you tell it not to, of course -
use (@emph{e.g.})  @code{(turn-off-backup 0)} to turn off the backup
(for molecule 0 in this case).}.

If you have made changes to more than one molecule, Coot will pop-up a
dialog box in which you should set the ``Undo Molecule'' @emph{i.e.}
the molecule to which the Undo operations will apply.  Further Undo
operations will continue to apply to this molecule until there are
none left.  If another Undo is requested Coot checks to see if there
are other molecules that can be undone, if there is exactly one, then
that molecule becomes the ``Undo Molecule'', if there are more than
one, then another Undo selection dialog will be displayed.

You can set the undo molecule using the scripting function:

@code{(set-undo-molecule @emph{imol})}

If for reasons of strange system@footnote{or system manager.}
requirements you want to remove the path components of the backup file
name you can do so using:

@code{(set-unpathed-backup-file-names 1)}

@subsection Redo
@cindex redo
The ``undone'' modifications can be re-done using this
button.  This is not available immediately after a
modification @footnote{It works like the ``Forwards'' buttons in a web
browser - which is not available immediately after viewing a new
page.}.

@subsection Restoring from Backup
@cindex restore after crash
 There may be certain
circumstances @footnote{for example, if coot crashes.} in which you
wish to restore from a backup but can't get it by the ``Undo''
mechanism described above.  In that case, start coot as normal and
then open the (typically most recent) coordinates file in the
directory @code{coot-backup} (or the directory pointed to the
environment variable @code{COOT_BACKUP_DIR} if it was set) .
This file should contain your most recent edits.  In such a case, it
is sensible for neatness purposes to immediately save the coordinates
(probably to the current directory) so that you are not modifying a
file in the backup directory.

See also Section @ref{Crash}.

@node View Matrix
@section View Matrix
@cindex view matrix 
It is sometimes useful to use this to orient the
view and export this orientation to other programs.  The orientation
matrix of the view can be displayed (in the console) using:

@code{(view-matrix)}

Also, the internal representation of the view can be returned and set
using:

@code{(view-quaternion)} to return a 4-element list

@code{(set-view-quaternion i j k l)} which sets the view quaternion.

So the usage of these functions would be something like:

@verbatim
(let ((v (view-quaternion)))
   ;; manipulate v here, maybe
   (apply set-view-quaternion v))
@end verbatim

@node Space Group and Symmetry 
@section Space Group and Symmetry 
Occasionally you may want to know the space group of a particular
molecule.  Interactively (for maps) you can see it using the Map
Properties button in the Molecule Display Control dialog.

There is a scripting interface function that returns the space group
for a given molecule  @footnote{if no space group has been assigned it
  returns @code{``No spacegroup for this molecule''}}:

@code{(show-spacegroup @emph{imol})}

You can force a space group onto a molecule using the following:

@code{(set-space-group @emph{imol} @emph{space-group})}

where @code{@emph{space-group}} is one of the standard CCP4 space group
names (@emph{e.g.} @code{@t{"P 21 21 21"}}).

@cindex space group operators
@cindex symmetry operators
To show the symmetry operators of a particular molecule use:
@code{(get-symmetry @emph{imol})}
which will return a list of strings.

Sometimes molecular replacement solutions (for example) create models
with chains non-optimally placed relative to each other - a
symmetry-related copy would be more apealling (but would be equivalent,
crystalographically). For example, to move the B chain to a
symmetry-related position:

Centre on an atom in the symmetry-related B chain (where you want the B chain to be)

@command{Extensions -> Modelling -> Symm Shift Reference Chain Here.}

@node Recentring View
@section Recentring View
@cindex recentring view 
@itemize
@item Use Control + left-mouse to drag around the view
@item or
@item middle-mouse over an atom.  In this case, you will often see
  ``slide-recentring'', the graphics smoothly changes between the
  current centre and the newly selected centre.
@item or
@item Use @command{Draw -> Go To Atom@dots{}} to select an atom
  using the keyboard.  Note that you can subsequently use ``Space'' in
  the ``graphics'' window (OpenGL canvas) to recentre on the next
  C@math{\alpha}.
@item or
@cindex set-rotation-centre
@cindex rotation centre
@item To centre on an arbitrary position (x,y,z), use the scripting function
   @code{(set-rotation-centre x y z)}.
@item or
@item Use the keyboard: [Ctrl G] then key in a residue number and (optionally) a chainid 
      and press Return
@end itemize

If you don't want smooth recentring (sliding)
@cindex sliding 
@command{Edit -> Preferences -> Smooth Recentring -> Off}.  You
can also use this dialog to speed it up a bit (by decreasing the
number of steps instead of turning it off).

@node Views
@section Views

Coot has a views interface (you might call them ''scenes``) that
define a particular orientation, zoom and view centre.  Coot and
linearly interpolate between the views.  The animation play back speed
can be set with the ''Views Play Speed`` menu item - default is a
speed of 10.

The views interface can be found under the Extensions menu item.

@node Clipping Manipulation
@section Clipping Manipulation
@cindex clipping
The clipping planes (a.k.a. ``slab''
@cindex slab 
) can
be adjusted using @command{Edit -> Clipping} and adjusting
the slider.  There is only one parameter to change and it affects both
the front and the back clipping planes @footnote{I find a clipping
  level of about 3.5 to 4 comfortable for viewing electron density
  maps - it is a little ``thinner'' than the default startup
  thickness.}.
The clipping can also be changed using keyboard ``D'' and ``F''.  

It can also be changed with Ctrl + Right-mouse drag up and down.
Likewise the screen-Z can be changed with Ctrl + Right-mouse left and
right @footnote{Inspired by PyMol?  Yep@dots{} sure was!}.


One can ``push'' and ``pull'' the view in the screen-Z direction using
keypad 3 and keypad ``.'' (see Section @ref{Keyboard Z Translation}).


@node Background colour
@section Background colour
@cindex background colour
The background colour can be set either using a GUI dialog
(@command{Edit$ -> Background Colour}) or the function
@code{(set-background-colour 0.00 0.00 0.00)}, where the arguments
are 3 numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, which respectively represent the
red, green and blue components of the background colour.  The default
is (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) (black).

@node Unit Cell
@section Unit Cell
@cindex unit cell
If coordinates have symmetry available then unit
cells can be drawn for molecules (@command{Draw -> Cell &
  Symmetry -> Show Unit Cell?}).

@node  Rotation Centre Pointer
@section Rotation Centre Pointer
@cindex rotation centre pointer 
There is a pink pointer
@cindex pink pointer
at the centre of the screen that marks the rotation centre.
The size of the pointer can be changed using @command{Edit
  -> Pink Pointer Size@dots{}} or using scripting commands:
@code{(set-rotation-centre-size 0.3)}.

@node  Orientation Axes
@section Orientation Axes
@cindex Orientation Axes

The green axes showing the orientation of the molecule are displayed
by default.  To remove them use the scripting function;

@code{(set-draw-axes 0)}


@node Pointer Distances
@section Pointer Distances
The Rotation Centre Pointer is sometimes called simply ``Pointer''.
One can find distances to the pointer from any active set of atoms
using ``Pointer Distances'' (under Measures).  If you move the Pointer
(@emph{e.g.} by centering on an atom) and want to update the distances
to it, you have to toggle off and on the ``Show Pointer Distances'' on
the Pointer Distances dialog.

@node Crosshairs
@section Crosshairs
@cindex crosshairs
Crosshairs can be drawn at the centre of the screen, using either the
@key{C} key@footnote{and @key{C} again to toggle them off.} in graphics
window or @command{Draw -> Crosshairs@dots{}}.  The ticks are at
1.54@AA{}, 2.7@AA{} and 3.8@AA{}.

@node 3D Annotations
@section 3D Annotations
@cindex annotations
Positions in 3D space can be annotated with 3D text.  The mechanism to
do this can be found under Extensions -> Representations -> 3D
Annotations.  3D Annotations can be saved to and loaded from a file.

@node Frame Rate
@section Frame Rate
@cindex frame rate
Sometimes, you might as yourself ``how fast is the computer?'' 
@footnote{compared to some other one.}.  Using @code{Calculate ->
Frames/Sec} you can see how fast the molecule is rotating, giving an
indication of graphics performance.  It is often better to use a map
that is more realistic and stop the picture whizzing round.  The output
is written to the status bar and the console, you need to give it a few
seconds to ``settle down''.  It is best not to have other widgets
overlaying the GL canvas as you do this.

The contouring elapsed time @footnote{prompted by changing the contour
  level.} gives an indication of CPU performance.

@node Program Output
@section Program Output
@cindex output 
Due to its ``in development'' nature (at the moment),
Coot produces a lot of ``console'' @footnote{@emph{i.e.} the terminal
  in which you started Coot.} output - much of it debugging or
``informational''.  This will go away in due course.  You are advised
to run Coot so that you can see the console and the graphics window at
the same time, since feedback from atom clicking (for example) is
often written there rather than displayed in the graphics window.

@itemize
@item Output that starts ``ERROR...'' is a programming problem (and
  ideally, you should never see it).
@item Output that starts ``WARNING...'' means that something probably
unintended happened due to the unexpected nature of your input or
file(s).
@item Output that starts ``DEBUG...'' has (obviously enough) been
  added to aid debugging.  Most of them should have been cleaned up
  before release, but as Coot is constantly being developed, a few may
  slip through.  Just ignore them.

@node Reading coordinates
@section Reading coordinates
The format
@cindex coordinates format
of coordinates that can be read by coot is either PDB or mmCIF.  To read
coordinates, choose @command{File -> Read Coordinates} from the
menu-bar.  Immediately after the coordinates have been read, the view is
(by default) recentred to the centre of this new molecule and the
molecule is displayed.  The recentring of the view after the coordinates
have been read can be turned off by unclicking the "Recentre?" 
radio-button.

To disable the recentring of the view on reading a coordinates file via
scripting, use: @code{(set-recentre-on-read-pdb 0)}.  However, when
reading a coordinates file from a script it is just as good (if not
better) to use @code{(handle-read-draw-molecule-with-recentre
@emph{filename} 0)} - the additional @code{0} means ``don't recentre''.
And that affects just the reading of @code{@emph{filename}} and not
subsequent files.

By default coot does not allow reading coordinates with duplicated
sequence numbers.  To enable the reading of files with duplicated
sequence numbers use the function:

@code{(allow-duplicate-sequence-numbers)}

Coot can read MDL mol files.

@subsection A Note on Space Groups Names
@cindex space group names
Coot uses the space group on the ``CRYST1'' line of the pdb file.  The
space group should be one of the xHM symbols listed (for example) in the
CCP4 dictionary file @file{syminfo.lib}.  So, for example, @t{"R 3 2 :H"}
should be used in preference to @t{"H32"}.

@subsection Read multiple coordinate files
@cindex reading multiple pdb files 
@cindex multiple coordinates files 
The reading multiple files using the GUI is not available (at the
moment).  However the following scripting functions are available:

@code{(read-pdb-all)}

which reads all the ``*.pdb'' files in the current directory

@code{(multi-read-pdb @emph{glob-pattern} @emph{dir})}

which reads all the files matching @code{@emph{glob-pattern}} in
directory @code{@emph{dir}}.  Typical usage of this might be:

@code{(multi-read-pdb "a*.pdb" ".")}

Alternatively you can specify the files to be opened on the command
line when you start coot (see Section
@ref{Command Line Arguments}).

@c @node    SHELX .ins/.res files
@subsection SHELX .ins/.res files
@cindex SHELX .ins

SHELX ".res" (and ".ins" of course) files can be read into Coot, either
using the GUI @command{File -> Open Coordinates@dots{}} or by the
scripting function:

@code{(read-shelx-ins-file @emph{file-name})}

where @code{@emph{file-name}} is quoted, such as @code{"thox.ins"}.

Although Coot should be able to read any SHELX ".res" file, it may
currently have trouble displaying the bonds for centro-symmetric
structures.

ShelxL atoms with negative @command{PART} numbers are given alternative
configuration identifiers in lower case.

To write a SHELX ".ins" file:

@code{(write-shelx-ins-file @emph{imol} @emph{file-name})}

where @code{@emph{imol}} is the number of the molecule you wish to
export.

This will be a rudimentary file if the coordinates were initially from a
"PDB" file, but will contain substantial SHELX commands if the
coordinates were initially generated from a SHELX @t{ins} file.  

@c I am pretty sure they are now.
@c The FVARs may not be correctly handled at present. 


@node    Atom Info
@section Atom Info
@cindex atom info
@cindex residue info 
Information about about a particular atom is displayed in the text
console when you click using middle-mouse.  Information for all the
atoms in a residue is available using @command{Info -> Residue
Info@dots{}}.

@cindex edit B-factors 
@cindex edit occupancy 
The temperature factors
and occupancy of the atoms in a residue can be set by using
@command{Edit -> Residue Info@dots{}}.

@node Atom Labeling
@section Atom Labeling
@cindex atom labeling 
Use Shift + left-mouse to label atom.  Do the same to toggle off the
label.  The font size is changeable using @command{Edit ->
  Font Size@dots{}}.  The newly centred atom is labelled by default.
To turn this off use:

@code{(set-label-on-recentre-flag 0)}

@cindex atom label, brief 
Some people prefer to have atom labels that
are shorter, without the slashes and residue name:

@code{(set-brief-atom-labels 1)}

To change the atom label colour, use:

@code{(set-font-colour 0.9 0.9 0.9)}


@node Atom Colouring
@section Atom Colouring
The atom colouring 
@cindex colouring, atoms
@cindex atom colouring 
system in coot is unsophisticated. Typically, atoms are coloured by
element: carbons are yellow, oxygens red, nitrogens blue, hydrogens
white and everything else green (see Section @ref{Display Manager}
for colour by chain).  However, it is useful to be able to distinguish
different molecules by colour, so by default coot rotates the colour
map of the atoms (@emph{i.e.} changes the H value in the
HSV @footnote{Hue Saturation Value (Intensity).}  colour system).  The
amount of the rotation depends on the molecule number and a
user-settable parameter:
@itemize
@item @code{(set-colour-map-rotation-on-read-pdb 30)}.
@end itemize

The default value is 31@math{^\circ}.

Also one is able to select only the Carbon atoms to change colour in
this manner: @code{(set-colour-map-rotation-on-read-pdb-c-only-flag
  1)}.

The colour map rotation can be set individually for each molecule by
using the GUI: @code{Edit -> Bond Colours@enddots{}}.

@node Bond Parameters
@section Bond Parameters
The various bond parameters can be set using the GUI dialog
@command{Draw -> Bond Parameters} or @emph{via} scripting
functions.

The represention style of the molecule that has the active residue (if any) 
can be changed using the scroll wheel with Ctrl and Shift.

@subsection Bond Thickness
@cindex bond thickness 
@cindex width, bonds
The thickness (width) of
bonds of individual molecules can be changed.  This can be done via the
@command{Bond Parameters} dialog or the scripting interface:

@code{(set-bond-thickness @emph{thickness imol})}

where @code{imol} is the molecule number. 

The default thickness is 3 pixels. The bond thickness also applies to
the symmetry atoms of the molecule. The default bond thickness for new
molecules can be set using:

@code{(set-default-bond-thickness @emph{thick})}

where @code{@emph{thick}} is an integer.

There is no means to change the
bond thickness of a residue selection within a molecule.

@subsection Display Hydrogens
@cindex hydrogens
Initially, hydrogens are displayed.  They can be
undisplayed using 

@code{(set-draw-hydrogens @emph{mol-no} 0)} @footnote{they
  can be redisplayed using @code{(set-draw-hydrogens @emph{mol-no} 1)}.}

where @code{@emph{mol-no}} is the molecule number.

There is a GUI to control this too, under ``Edit -> Bond Parameters''.

@subsection NCS Ghosts Coordinates
@cindex NCS 
It is occasionally useful when analysing non-crystallographically
related molecules to have ``images'' of the other related molecules
appear matched onto the current coordinates.  It is important to
understand that these ghosts are for displaying differences of
NCS-related molecules by structure superposition, not displaying
neighbouring NCS related molecules.  As you read in coordinates in
Coot, they are checked for NCS relationships and clicking on ``Edit ->
Bond Parameters -> Show NCS Ghosts'' -> ``Yes'' -> ``Apply'' will
create ``ghost'' copies of them over the reference chain @footnote{the
reference chain is, by default, the first chain of that type in the
coordinates file.  The reference (master) chain can be changed using
the NCS Ghosts Control dialog.}.

Sometimes SSM does not provide a good (or even useful) matrix.  In that
case, we can specify the residue range ourselves and let the LSQ
algorithm provide the matrix.  A gui dialog for this operation can be
found under @command{Extensions -> NCS -> NCS Ghosts by Residue
Range@dots{}}.

The scripting function is used like this:

@code{(manual-ncs-ghosts @emph{imol resno-start resno-end ncs-chain-ids})}

 Typical usage: @t{(manual-ncs-ghosts 0 1 10 (list "A" "B" "C"))}

note that in @code{@emph{ncs-chain-ids}}, the NCS master/reference
chain-id goes first.

@subsection NCS Maps
Coot can use the relative transformations of the NCS-related molecules
in a coordinates molecule to transform maps. Use @command{Calculate}
-> @command{NCS Maps@dots{}} to do this (note the NCS maps
only make sense in the region of the reference chain (see above).

Note also that the internal representation of the map is not
transformed.  If you try to export a NCS overlay map you will get an
untransformed map.  A transformed map only makes sense around a given
point (and when using transformed maps in Coot, this reference point is
changed on the fly, thus allowing map transformations on the fly).
[This applies to NCS overlap maps, NCS averaged maps are transformed].

@cindex NCS averaging
This will also create an NCS averaged
map @footnote{that also only makes sense in the region of the reference
  chain.}.

@subsection Using Strict NCS
Coot can use a set of strict NCS matrices to specify NCS which means
that NCS-related molecules can appear like convention symmetry-related
molecules.

@code{(add-strict-ncs-matrix @emph{imol ncs-chain-id ncs-target-chain-id m11 m12 m13 m21 m22 m23 m31 m32 m33 t1 t2 t3})}

where @code{@emph{ncs-chain-id}} might be "B", "C" "D" (etc.) and
@code{@emph{ncs-target-chain-id}} is "A", i.e. the B, C, D molecules are
NCS copies of the A chain.

for icosahedral symmetry the translation components @code{@emph{t1}}, 
@code{@emph{t2}}, @code{@emph{t3}} will be 0.

You need to turn on symmetry for molecule @code{@emph{imol}} and set the
displayed symmetry object type to "Display Near Chains".


@node Download coordinates
@section Download coordinates
Coot provides the possibility to download coordinates from an
@cindex OCA 
OCA @footnote{OCA is ``goose'' in Spanish (and Italian)}.
@cindex goose 
(@emph{e.g.} EBI) server @footnote{the default is the
  Weizmann Institute - which for reasons I won't go into here is
  currently much faster than the EBI server.} (@command{File
  -> Get PDB Using Code@dots{}}). A pop-up entry box is
displayed into which you can type a PDB accession code.  Coot will
then connect to the web server and transfer the file.  Coot blocks as
it does this (which is not ideal) but on a semi-decent internet
connection, it's not too bad.  The downloaded coordinates are saved
into a directory called @file{coot-download}.

It is also possible to download mmCIF data and generate a map.  This
currently requires a properly formatted database structure factors
mmCIF file @footnote{which (currently) only a fraction are.}.

@node    Get Coordinates and Map from EDS
@section Get Coordinates and Map from EDS
@cindex  Electron Density Server

Using this function we have the ability to download coordinates and view
the map from structures in the Electron Density Server (EDS) at Uppsala
University.  This is a much more robust and faster way to see maps from
deposited structures.  This function can be found under the File menu
item.

This feature was added with the assistance of Gerard Kleywegt.  If you
use the EDS, please cite GJ Kleywegt, MR Harris, JY Zou, TC Taylor, A
W@"ahlby & TA Jones (2004), @i{"The Uppsala Electron-Density Server"}, @i{Acta
Cryst.} @b{D}60, 2240-2249.

@node Save coordinates
@section Save Coordinates
On selecting from the menus @command{File -> Save
  Coordinates@dots{}} you are first presented with a list of molecules
which have coordinates.  As well as the molecule number, there is the
molecule name - very frequently the name of the file that was read in
to generate the coordinates in coot initially.  However, this is only
a @emph{molecule} name and should not be confused with the filename to
which the coordinates are saved.  The coordinates @emph{filename} can
be selected using the @command{Select Filename@dots{}} button.

If your filename ends in @code{.cif}, @code{.mmcif} or
@code{.mmCIF} then an mmCIF file will be written (not a ``PDB''
file).

@node    Setting the Space Group
@section Setting the Space Group
@cindex  setting space group

If for some reason, the pdb file that you read does not have a space
group, or has the wrong space group, then you can set it using the
following function:

@code{(set-space-group @emph{imol} @emph{symbol})}

e.g.:

@code{(set-space-group 0 "P 41 21 2")}

@node Anisotropic Atoms
@section Anisotropic Atoms
@cindex anisotropic atoms
By default anisotropic atom information is
not represented @footnote{using thermal ellipsoids}.  To turn them on,
use @command{Draw -> Anisotropic Atoms -> Show
  Anisotropic Atoms?  -> Yes}, or the command:
@code{(set-show-aniso 1)}.

You cannot currently display thermal ellipsoids @footnote{in the case
  of isotropic atoms, ellipsoids are spherical, of course.} for
isotropic atoms.

@node Symmetry
@section Symmetry
@cindex symmetry 
Coordinates symmetry is ``dynamic''.  Symmetry atoms
can be labeled @footnote{symmetry labels are in pale blue/purple and also
  provide the symmetry operator number and the translations along the
  a, b and c axes.}.  

Every time you recentre, the symmetry coordinates are updated.  The
information shown contains the atom information and the symmetry
operation number and translations needed to generate the atom in that
position.  To show the symmetry operator as a string (rather than a
(1-based) index into the list of symmetry operators (as is the default))
Use @command{Draw -> Show Symmetry> -> Expanded Symmetry Atom Labels}.
Coot generates symmetry related atoms by moving the current set close to
the origin by a translation, performing the symmetry expansion around
the origin and moving the the symmetry coordinates back by applying the
inverse of the origin translation.  The origin translation is also
displayed in curly braces, e.g. ``@{1 -1 0@}''.

By default symmetry atoms are not displayed.  

If you want coot to display symmetry coordinates without having to use
the gui, add to your @file{~/.coot} the following:

@code{(set-show-symmetry-master 1)}


The symmetry can be represented as C@math{\alpha}s.
@cindex C@math{\alpha} symmetry
This along with representation of the molecule as
C@math{\alpha}s (Section @ref{Display Manager}) allow the production of
a packing diagram.
@cindex packing diagram

@subsection Missing symmetry
@cindex missing symmetry

Sometimes (rarely) coot misses symmetry-related molecules that should be
displayed.  In that case you need to expand the shift search (the default is 1):

@code{(set-symmetry-shift-search-size 2)}

This is a hack, until the symmetry search algorithm is improved.
       

@node Sequence View
@section Sequence View
@cindex sequence view
 The protein is represented by one letter codes
and coloured according to secondary structure.  These one letter codes
are active - if you click on them, they will change the centre of the
graphics window - in much the same way as clicking on a residue in the
Ramachandran plot.

@node Print Sequence 
@section Print Sequence 
@cindex Print Sequence 
The single letter code (of the @code{@emph{imol}}th molecule) is written
out to the console in FASTA format.  Use can use this to cut and paste
into other applications:

@code{(print-sequence @emph{imol})}

@node Environment Distances
@section Environment Distances
Environment distances are turned on using @command{Info -> Environment
Distances@dots{}}.  Contacts to other residues are shown and to
symmetry-related atoms if symmetry is being displayed.  The contacts
are coloured by atom type @footnote{contacts involving two hydrogens
or at least one carbon atom are yellow, denoting 'bump'.  Hydrogen
contacts display cut-off are based on the user-defined maximum
distance, but shortened by 0.5@AA{} per hydrogen atom.}.

@node Distances and Angles
@section Distances and Angles
The distance between atoms can be found using @command{Info
  -> Distance} @footnote{Use @command{Angle} for an angle, of
  course.}.  The result is displayed graphically, and written to the
console.

@node Zero Occupancy Marker
@section Zero Occupancy Marker
@cindex zero occupancy
Atoms of zero occupancy are marked with a grey
spot. To turn off these markers, use:

@code{(set-draw-zero-occ-markers 0)}

Use an argument of 1 to turn them on.

@node Atomic Dots
@section Atomic Dots
@cindex atomic dots

You can draw dots round arbitrary atom selections

@code{(dots @emph{imol atom-selection dot-density radius})}
The function returns a handle.

@emph{e.g.} put a sphere of dots around all atoms of the 0th molecule
(it might be a set of heavy atom coordinates) at the default dot density
and radius:

@code{(dots 0 "/1"  "heavy-atom-sites" 1 1)}

You can't change the colour of the dots.  

There is no internal mechanism to change the radius according to atom
type.  With some cleverness you might be able to call this function
several times and change the radius according to the atom selection.

There is a function to clear up the dots for a particular molecule
@code{@emph{imol}} and dots set identifier @code{@emph{dots-handle}}

@code{(clear-dots @emph{imol dots-handle})}

There is a function to return how many dots sets there are for a 
particular molecule @code{@emph{imol}}:

@code{(n-dots-set @emph{imol})}

@node Ball and Stick Representation
@section Ball and Stick Representation
@cindex ball and stick

Fragments of the molecule can be rendered as a ``ball and stick'' molecule:

@code{(make-ball-and-stick @emph{imol atom-selection bond-thickness sphere-size draw-spheres-flag})}

e.g. 
@code{(make-ball-and-stick 0 "/1/A/10-20" 0.3 0.4 1)}

The ball-and-stick representation can be cleared using:

@code{(clear-ball-and-stick @emph{imol})}



@node Mean and Median Temperature Factors
@section Mean, Median Temperature Factors
Coot can be used to calculate the 
@cindex mean B-factor
mean (average)
and
@cindex median B-factor
median temperatures factors:

@code{(average-temperature-factor @emph{imol})}

@code{(median-temperature-factor @emph{imol})}

@math{-1} is returned if there was a problem @footnote{@emph{e.g.} this
molecule was a map or a closed molecule.}.

@node    Secondary Structure Matching (SSM)
@section Secondary Structure Matching (SSM)
@cindex  Secondary Structure Matching (SSM)
@cindex  superposition

The excellent SSM alogrithm@footnote{the same one as in the CCP4 program
SUPERPOSE} of Eugene Krissinel is available in Coot.  The GUI interface
is straight-forward and can be found under @command{Calculate -> SSM
Superpose}.  You can specify the specific chains that you wish to match
using the "Use Specific Chain" check-button.

There is a scripting level function which gives even finer control:

@code{(superpose-with-atom-selection @emph{imol1 imol2
mmdb-atom-selection-string-1 mmdb-atom-selection-string-2
move-copy-flag} )}

the @code{@emph{move-copy-flag}} should be 1 if you want to apply the
transformation to a copy of @code{@emph{imol2}} (rather than
@code{@emph{imol2}} itself). Otherwise, @code{@emph{move-copy-flag}}
should be 0.

mmdb atom selection strings (Coordinate-IDs) are explained in detail in
the mmdb manual.

Briefly, the string should be formed in this manner:

@code{/mdl/chn/seq(res).ic/atm[elm]:aloc}

@emph{e.g.} @code{"/1/A/12-130/CA"}

@ifhtml

@node  Least-Squares Fitting
@section Least-Squares Fitting
@cindex Least Squares Fitting

There is a simple GUI for this @command{Calculate -> LSQ Superpose@dots{}}

The scripting interface to LSQ fitting is as follows:

@code{(simple-lsq-match @emph{ref-start-resno ref-end-resno ref-chain-id imol-ref
           mov-start-resno mov-end-resno mov-chain-id imol-mov
           match-type})}

where:
@itemize
@item @code{@emph{ref-start-resno}} is the starting residue number
  of the reference molecule
@item @code{@emph{ref-end-resno}} is the last residue number
  of the reference molecule
@item @code{@emph{mov-start-resno}} is the starting residue number
  of the moving molecule
@item @code{@emph{mov-end-resno}} is the last residue number
  of the moving molecule
@item @code{@emph{match-type}} is one of @code{'CA},
  @code{'main}, or @code{'all}.
@end itemize

@emph{e.g.}: 
@code{(simple-lsq-match 940 950 "A" 0 940 950 "A" 1 'main)}

More sophisticated (match molecule number 1 chain ``B'' on to molecule
number 0 chain ``A''):

@code{(define match1 (list 840 850 "A" 440 450 "B" 'all))}

@code{(define match2 (list 940 950 "A" 540 550 "B" 'main))}

@code{(clear-lsq-matches)}

@code{(set-match-element match1)}

@code{(set-match-element match2)}

@code{(apply-lsq-matches 0 1)} ; match molecule number 1 onto molecule number 0.

@c %% @itemize 
@c %% @item @code{(define match1 (list 840 850 "A" 440 450 "B" 'all))}

@c %% @end itemize

@node  Ligand Overlaying
@section Ligand Overlaying
@cindex ligand, overlay
@cindex overlaying ligands

The scripting function 

@code{(overlap-ligands @emph{imol-ligand imol-ref chain-id-ref resno-ref})}

returns a rotation+translation operator which can be applied to other
molecules (and maps).  Here, @code{@emph{imol-ligand}} is the molecule
number of the ligand (which is presumed to be a a molecule on its own -
Coot simply takes the first residue that it finds). @code{@emph{imol-ref
chain-id-ref resno-ref}} collectively describe the target position for
the moving @code{@emph{imol-ligand}} molecule.

The convenience function 

@code{(overlay-my-ligands @emph{imol-mov chain-id-mov resno-mov imol-ref chain-id-ref resno-ref})} 

wraps @code{overlap-ligands}.  

The GUI for the function can be found under 

@command{Extensions -> Modelling -> Supperpose Ligands@dots{}}

@node Writing PDB files
@section Writing PDB files
@cindex writing PDBs

As well as the GUI option @command{File -> Save Coordinates@dots{}} there
is a scripting options available:

@code{(write-pdb-file @emph{imol pdb-file-name})}

which writes the @code{@emph{imol}}th coordinates molecule to
@code{@emph{filename}}.

To write a specific residue range: 

@code{(write-residue-range-to-pdb-file @emph{imol chain-id start-resno

The functions described in this chapter manipulate, extend or build

  of the main graphics window @footnote{given a half-decent window

Coot will read the geometry restraints for
refmac and use them in fragment (zone) idealization - this is called
``Regularization''.
@cindex regularization 
  The geometrical restraints
are, by default, bonds, angles, planes
@cindex planes 
 and non-bonded
contacts.  You can additionally use torsion restraints
@cindex torsion restraints
by @command{Calculate -> Model/Fit/Refine@dots{} -> Refine/Regularize Control
  -> Use Torsion Restraints}.  Truth to tell, this has not been
  successful in my hands (sadly).

``RS (Real Space) Refinement''
@cindex refinement
 (after Diamond,
1971 @footnote{Diamond, R. (1971). A Real-Space Refinement Procedure
  for Proteins. @emph{Acta Crystallographica} @b{A}27, 436-452.
  }) in Coot is the use of the map in addition to geometry terms to
improve the positions of the atoms.  Select ``Regularize'' from the
``Model/Fit/Refine'' dialog and click on 2 atoms to define the zone
(you can of course click on the same atom twice if you only want to
regularize one residue).  Coot then regularizes the residue range.  At
the end Coot, displays the intermediate atoms in white and also
displays a dialog, in which you can accept or reject this
regularization.  In the console are displayed the @math{\chi^2}
values of the various geometrical restraints for the zone before 
and after the regularization.  Usually the @math{\chi^2} values are 
considerably decreased - structure idealization such as this should 
drive the @math{\chi^2} values toward zero.

The use of ``Refinement'' is similar - with the addition of using a
map.  The map used to refine the structure is set by using the
``Refine/Regularize Control'' dialog.  If you have read/created only
one map into Coot, then that map will be used (there is no need to set
it explicitly).


Use, for example, 
@cindex @code{set-matrix}
@cindex weight, real space refinement
@cindex refinement weight
@code{(set-matrix 20.0)}


to change the weight of the map gradients to geometric gradients.  The
higher the number the more weight that is given to the map terms
@footnote{but the resulting @math{\chi^2} values are higher.}.  The
default is 60.0.  This will be needed for maps generated from data not
on (or close to) the absolute scale or maps that have been scaled (for
example so that the sigma level has been scaled to 1.0).

For both ``Regularize Zone'' and ``Refine Zone'' one is able to use a
single click to
@cindex single click refine 
@cindex refine single click 
refine a residue range.  Pressing @key{A} on the keyboard while
selecting an atom in a residue will automatically create a residue
range with that residue in the middle.  By default the zone is
extended one residue either size of the central residue.  This can be
changed to 2 either side using @code{(set-refine-auto-range-step
  2)}.

Intermediate (white) atoms can be moved around with the mouse (click
and drag with left-mouse, by default).  
@c \marginpar{ @footnotesize
@c   @command{This is a useful feature}} 
Refinement will proceed from the
new atom positions when the mouse button is released.  It is possible
to create incorrect atom nomenclature and/or chiral volumes in this
manner - so some care must be taken.  Press the @key{A} key as you
left-mouse click to move atoms more ``locally'' (rather than a linear
shear) and @key{Ctrl} key as you left-mouse click to move just one atom.

In more up to date versions, Coot will display colour patches (something
like a traffic light system) 
@cindex traffic lights
representing the chi squared values of each
of types of geometric feature refined.  Typically ``5 greens'' is the
thing to aim for, the colour changes occurring at chi squared values 2, 5
and 8 (8 being the most red).

To prevent the unintentional refinement of a large number of residues,
there is a ``heuristic fencepost'' of 20 residues.  A selection of
than 20 residues will not be regularized or refined.  The limit can be
changed using the scripting function: @emph{e.g.}
@code{(set-refine-max-residues 30)}.

@node Dictionary
@subsection Dictionary
@cindex cif dictionary 
@cindex mmCIF dictionary 

The geometry description for residues, monomers and links used by Coot
are in the standard mmCIF format.  Because this format alows multiple
comp_ids (residue types) to be described within a cif loop, it is hard
to tell when a dictionary entry needs to be overwritten when reading a
new file.  Therefore Coot makes this extra constraint: that the
``chem_comp'' loop should appear first in the comp list data item - if
this is the case, then Coot can overwrite an old restraint table for a
particular comp_id/residue-type when a new one is read.

By default, 
the geometry dictionary entries for only the standard
residues are read in at the start  @footnote{And a few extras, such as
  phosphate}.  It may be that your particular ligand is not amongst
these.  To interactively add a dictionary entry use @command{File
  -> Import CIF Dictionary}.

There is a selector in the cif dictionary file chooser that allow you to
select the molecule to which molecule refers. Each of the indididual
molecules can be specifically selected. ``All`` means that the dictionary
refers to all loaded molecules and ``Auto`` means that the dictionary will
be applied to all model molecules if the comp_id/residue name is not on the
non-auto-load list and will choose the latest model molecule if the comp_id/residue
name is on the non-auto-load list. By default the non-auto-load list
consists of INH, LIG, DRG, XXX, and the series LG0-9.


Alternatively, you can use
the function:

@code{(read-cif-dictionary @emph{filename})}

and add this to your @code{.coot} file (this may be the preferred
method if you want to read the file on more than one occasion).  

Note: the dictionary also provides the description of the ligand's
torsions.

@node       Sphere Refinement
@subsection Sphere Refinement
@cindex sphere refinement

Sphere refinement selects residues within a certain distance of the
residue at the centre of the screen and includes them for real space
refinement.  In this way, one can select residues that are not in a
linear range.  This technique is useful for refining disulfide bonds and
glycosidic linkages.

To enable sphere refinement, Right-mouse click in the right hand side of
the horizontal toolbutton menu, Manage buttons -> [Tick] Sphere Refine
-> Apply.  You will need a python-enabled Coot to do this.

The following adds a key binding (Shift-R) that refines resides that are
within 3.5@AA{} of the residue at the centre of the screen:

@verbatim
        
(define *sphere-refine-radius* 3.5)

(add-key-binding "Refine residues in a sphere" "R"
    (lambda ()
     (using-active-atom
      
      (let* ((rc-spec (list aa-chain-id aa-res-no aa-ins-code))
	     (ls (residues-near-residue aa-imol rc-spec *sphere-refine-radius*)))
	(refine-residues aa-imol (cons rc-spec ls))))))


@end verbatim


@node       Refining Specific Residues
@subsection Refining Specific Residues
@cindex refining residues

You can specify the residues that you want to refine without using a
linear or sphere selection usine @code{refine-residues}.   For example:

@code{(refine-residues 0 '(("L" 501 "") ("L" 503 "")))}

will refine residues A501 and A503 (and residue A502 (if it exists)
will be an anchoring residue - used in optimizing the link geometry of
the atoms in A501 and A503).

@node       Refining Carbohydrates
@subsection Refining Carbohydrates
@cindex carbohydrates

Refining carbohydrates monomers should be as straightforward as refining
a protein residue.  Coot will look in the dictionary for the 3-letter
code for the particular residue type, if it does not find it, Coot will
try to search for dictionary files using ``-b-D'' or ``-a-L'' extensions.

When refining a group of carbohydrates, the situation needs a bit more
explanation. For each residue pair with tandem residue numbers specified
in the refinement range selection, Coot checks if these residue types
are are furanose or pyranose in the dictionary, and if the are both one
or the other, then it tries to see if there are any of the 11 link types
(BETA1-4, BETA2-3, ALPHA1-2 and so on) specified in the dictionary.  It
does this by a distance check of the potentially bonding atoms.  If the
distance is less than 3.0@AA{}, then a glycosidic bond is made and used
in the refinement.

Bonds between protein and carbohydrate and branched carbohydrates can be
refined using ``Sphere Refinement''.

Instead of using a sphere to make a residue selection, you can specify
the residues directly using @code{refine-residues}, for example:

@code{(refine-residues 0 '(("L" 501 "") ("L" 503 "")))}

LINK and LINKR cards are not yet used to determine the geometry of the
restraints.



@node Planar Peptide Restraints
@subsection Planar Peptide Restraints
@cindex planar peptide restraints
@cindex peptide restraints, planar

By default, Coot uses a 5 atom (CA-1, C-1, O-1, N-2, CA-2) planar
peptide restraints.  These restraints should help in low resolution
fitting (the main-chains becomes less distorted), reduce accidental
cis-peptides and may help ``clean up'' Ramachandran plots.

@code{(add-planar-peptide-restraints)}

And similarly they can be removed:

@code{(remove-planar-peptide-restraints)}

There is also a GUI to add and remove these restraints in
@code{Extensions -> Refine@dots{} -> Peptide Restraints@dots{}} 




@node The UNK residue type
@subsection The UNK residue type
@cindex  @code{UNK} residue 

The @code{UNK} residue type is a special residue type to Coot.  It has
been added for use with Buccaneer. Don't give you ligand (or anything
else) the 3-letter-code @code{UNK} or confusion will result
@footnote{unless you are using Buccaneer, of course}.

@node Moving Zero Occupancy Atoms
@subsection Moving Zero Occupancy Atoms
@cindex  Moving Zero Occupancy Atoms

By default, atoms with zero occupancy are moved when refining and
regularizing.  This can sometimes be inconvenient.  To turn of the
movement of atoms with zero occupancy when refining and regularizing:

@code{(set-refinement-move-atoms-with-zero-occupancy 0)}


@c --------------------------------------------------
@node    Changing the Map for Building/Refinement
@section Changing the Map for Building/Refinement
@cindex  changing the Refinement Map
@cindex  map changing (for refinement/building)

You can change the map that is used for the fitting and refinement tools
using the @command{Select Map@enddots{}} button on the Model/Fit/Refine
dialog.


@node Rotate/Translate Zone
@section Rotate/Translate Zone
@cindex rotate/translate, manual 

``Rotate/Translate Zone'' from the ``Model/Fit/Refine'' menu allows
manual movement of a zone.  After pressing the ``Rotate/Translate Zone''
button, select two atoms in the graphics canvas to define a residue
range @footnote{if you
  want to move only one residue, then click the same atom twice.}, the
second atom that you click will be the local rotation centre for the
zone.  The atoms selected in the moving fragment have the same
alternate conformation code as the first atom you click.  To actuate a
transformation, click and drag horizontally across the relevant button
in the newly-created ``Rotation & Translation'' dialog. The axis
system of the rotations and translations are the screen coordinates.
Alternatively  @footnote{like Refinement and Regularization}, you can
click using left-mouse on an atom in the fragment and drag the
fragment around. Use Control Left-mouse to move just one atom, rather
than the whole fragment.  If you click Control Left-mouse whilst @emph{not} 
over an atom then you can rotate the fragment using mouse drag. 
Click ``OK'' (or press Return) when the transformation is complete.

To change the rotation point to the centre of the intermediate atoms
(rather than the second clicked atom), use the setting:

@code{(set-rotate-translate-zone-rotates-about-zone-centre 1)}

@node Rigid Body Refinement  
@section Rigid Body Refinement
@cindex refinement, rigid body
@cindex rigid body fit 
``Rigid Body Fit Zone'' from the
``Model/Fit/Refine'' dialog provides rigid body refinement.  The
selection is zone-based @footnote{like Regularization and Refinement.}.
So to refine just one residue, click on one atom twice.

Sometimes no results are displayed after Rigid Body Fit Zone.  This is
because the final model positions had too many final atom positions in
negative density.  If you want to over-rule the default fraction of
atoms in the zone that have an acceptable fit (0.75), to be (say)
0.25:

@code{(set-rigid-body-fit-acceptable-fit-fraction 0.25)}

@node    Simplex Refinement 
@section Simplex Refinement
@cindex  simplex refinement
@cindex refinement, simplex

Rigid body refinement via Nelder-Mead Simplex minimization is available
in Coot.  Simplex refinement has a larger radius of convergence and thus
is useful in a position where simple rigid body refinement finds the
wrong minimum. However the Simplex algorithm is much slower.  Simplex
refinement for a residue range @code{@emph{start-resno}} to
@code{@emph{end-resno}} (inclusive) in chain @code{@emph{chain-id}} can
be accessed as follows:

@code{(fit-residue-range-to-map-by-simplex @emph{start-resno end-resno alt-loc 
        chain-id imol imol-for-map})}

There is currently no GUI interface to Simplex refinement.

@node    Post-manipulation-hook
@section Post-manipulation-hook
@cindex  post-manipulation-hook

If you wanted automatically run a function after a model has been
manipulated then you can do so using by creating a function that takes
2 arguments, such as:

@code{(post-manipulation-hook @emph{imol manipulation-mode})}

@code{@emph{manipulation-mode}} is one of @code{@emph{(DELETED)}},
@code{@emph{(MUTATED)}} or @code{@emph{(MOVINGATOMS)}}.

And of course @code{@emph{imol}} is the model number of the maniplated
molecule.

(It would of course be far more useful if this function was also
passed a list of residues - that is something for the future).

@node    Baton Building
@section Baton Building
@cindex  baton build 

Baton build is most useful if a skeleton is already calculated and
displayed (see Section @ref{Skeletonization}).  When three or more atoms
have been built in a chain, Coot will use a prior probability
distribution for the next position based on the position of the previous
three.  The analysis is similar to that of Oldfield & Hubbard (1994)
@footnote{T. J.  Oldfield & R. E. Hubbard (1994).  ``Analysis of
C@math{\alpha} Geometry in Protein Structures'' @emph{Proteins-Structure
Function and Genetics} @b{18(4)} 324 -- 337.}, however it is based on a
more recent and considerably larger database.

Little crosses are drawn representing directions in which is is
possible that the chain goes, and a baton is drawn from the current
point to one of these new positions.  If you don't like this
particular direction @footnote{which is quite likely at first since
  coot has no knowledge of where the chain has been and cannot score
  according to geometric criteria.}, use @command{Try Another}.  The
list of directions is scored according to the above criterion and
sorted so that the most likely is at the top of the list and displayed
first as the baton direction.

When starting baton building, be sure to be about 3.8@AA{} from the
position of the first-placed C@math{\alpha}, this is because the next
C@math{\alpha} is placed at the end of the baton, the baton root being at
the centre of the screen.  So, when trying to baton-build a chain
starting at residue 1, centre the screen at about the position of
residue 2.

It seems like a good idea to increase the map sampling to 2 or even 2.5
(before reading in your mtz file) [a grid sampling of about 0.5@AA{}
seems reasonable] when trying to baton-build a low resolution map.  You
can set the map sampling using @command{Edit -> Map Parameters -> Map
Sampling}.

@c %%% FIXME: Tell me where it is in the gui

@c % ``b'' key in GL canvas
@cindex baton mode 
Occasionally, every point is not where you want to
position the next atom.  In that case you can either shorten or
lengthen the baton, or position it yourself using the mouse.  Use
``b'' on the keyboard to swap to baton mode for the
mouse @footnote{``b'' again toggles the mode off.}.

Baton-built atoms are placed into a molecule called ``Baton Atom'' and
it is often sensible to save the coordinates of this molecule before
quitting coot.

If you try to trace a high resolution map (1.5@AA{}  or better) you will
need to increase the skeleton search depth from the default (10), for
example:

@code{(set-max-skeleton-search-depth 20)}

Alternatively, you could generate a new map using data
to a more moderate resolution (2@AA{}), the map may be easier to
interpret at that resolution anyhow @footnote{high-resolution map
  interpretation is planned.}.

The guide positions are updated every time the ``Accept'' button is
clicked.  The molecule name for these atoms is ``Baton Build Guide Points''
and is is not usually necessary to keep them.

@subsection Undo 
There is also an ``Undo'' button for baton-building.  Pressing this
will delete the most recently placed C@math{\alpha} and the guide points
will be recalculated for the previous position.  The number of
``Undo''s is unlimited.  Note that you should use the ``Undo'' button
in the Baton Build dialog, not the one in the ``Model/Fit/Refine''
dialog (Section @ref{Backups and Undo}).

@subsection Missing Skeleton 
@cindex skeleton, missing
Sometimes (especially at loops) you can see
the direction in which the chain should go, but there is no skeleton
(see Section @ref{Skeletonization}) is displayed (and consequently no
guide points) in that direction. In that case, ``Undo'' the previous
atom and decrease the skeletonization level (@command{Edit
  -> Skeleton Parameters -> Skeletonization
  Level}).  Accept the atom (in the same place as last time) and now
when the new guide points are displayed, there should be an option to
build in a new direction.

@subsection Building Backwards
The following scenario is not uncommon: you find a nice stretch of
density and start baton building in it.  After a while you come to a
point where you stop (dismissing the baton build dialog).  You want to
go back to where you started and build the other way.  How do you do
that?

@itemize
@item Use the command: 

@code{(set-baton-build-params @emph{start-resno}
    @emph{chain-id} "backwards")}

where @code{@emph{start-resno}} would typically
    be 0 @footnote{@emph{i.e.} one less than the starting residue in the
    forward direction (defaults to 1).} and @code{@emph{chain-id}} would be
    @code{""} (default).
@item Recentre the graphics window on the first atom of the just-build
  fragment
@item Select ``Ca Baton Mode'' and select a baton direction
  that goes in the ``opposite'' direction to what is typically residue
  2.  This is slightly awkward because the initial baton atoms build
  in the ``opposite'' direction are not dependent on the first few
  atoms of the previously build fragment.
@end itemize

@node Reversing Direction of Fragment
@section Reversing Direction of Fragment
@cindex reverse direction
@cindex fragment direction change

After you've build a fragment, sometimes you might want to change the
direction of that fragment (this function changes an already existing
fragment, as opposed to Backwards Building which sets up Baton Building
to place new points in reverse order).

The fragment is defined as a contiguous set of residues numbers.  So
that you should be sure that other partial fragments which have the same
chain id and that are not connected to this fragment have residue
numbers that are not contiguous with the fragment you are trying to
reverse.  

@c markup properly when you have a manual.
@c e.g.:    
@c 
@c          other fragment   fragment-for-reversing   other fragment
@c residues      1-20                 22-32                  34-60



@node C-alpha -> Mainchain
@section C@math{\alpha} -> Mainchain 
@cindex mainchain 
Mainchain can be generated using a set of C@math{\alpha}s
as guide-points (such as those from Baton-building) along the line of
Esnouf @footnote{R. M. Esnouf ``Polyalanine Reconstruction from
  C@math{\alpha} Positions Using the Program @emph{CALPHA} Can Aid Initial
  Phasing of Data by Molecular Replacement Procedures'' @emph{Acta
    Cryst. }, D@b{53}, 666-672 (1997).} or Jones and
coworkers @footnote{T.A.  Jones & S. Thirup ``Using known
  substructures in protein model building and crystallography''
  @emph{EMBO J.} @b{5}, 819--822 (1986).}.  Briefly, 6-residue
fragments of are generated from a list of high-quality @footnote{and
  high resolution} structures. The C@math{\alpha} atoms of these fragments
are matched against overlapping sets of the guide-point C@math{\alpha}s.
The resulting matches are merged to provide positions for the
mainchain (and C@math{\beta}) atoms.  This procedure works well for
helices and strands, but less well @footnote{@emph{i.e.}  there are
  severely misplaced atoms} for less common structural features.

This function is also available from the scripting interface:

@code{(db-mainchain @emph{imol chain-id resno-start resno-end direction})}
    
where direction is either @code{"backwards"} or @code{"forwards"}. 

Recall that the @code{@emph{chain-id}} needs to be quoted, @emph{i.e.}
use @code{"A"} not @code{A}.  Note that @code{@emph{chain-id}} is
@code{""} when the C@math{\alpha}s have been built with Baton Mode in
Coot.


@c % Withdrawn due to being to difficult to calculate the atom positions 
@c % given the phi and psi
@c %
@c %@section{Edit Phi/Psi}
@c %@cindex{edit $\phi/\psi$}This generates a Ramachandran plot with only
@c %one residue represented.  You can click and drag this residue round
@c %the plot and the coordinates in the graphics window will change to the
@c %$\phi/\psi$ values in the Ramachandran plot.

@node    Backbone Torsion Angles 
@section Backbone Torsion Angles
@cindex mainchain torsions
It is possible to edit the backbone @math{\phi} and @math{\psi} angles
indirectly using an option in the Model/Fit/Refine's dialog: ``Edit
Backbone Torsions..''. When clicked and an atom of a peptide is
selected, this produces a new dialog that offers ``Rotate Peptide''
which changes this residues @math{\psi} and ``Rotate Carbonyl'' which
changes @math{\phi}.  Click and drag across the button @footnote{as for
Rotate/Translate Zone (Section @ref{Rotate/Translate Zone}).} to rotate
the moving atoms in the graphics window.  You should know, of course,
that making these modifications alter the @math{\phi/\psi} angles of
more than one residue.


@node Docking Sidechains
@section Docking Sidechains
@cindex docking sidechains
@cindex sidechains

Docking sidechains means adding sidechains to a model or fragment that
has currently only poly-Ala, where the sequence assignment is unknown.
The algorithm is basically the same as in Cowtan's Buccaneer, but with
some corners cut to make things (more or less) interactive.  The
algorithm uses the shape of the density around the C-beta position to
estimate the probability of each sidechain type at that position.

The function is accessed via the @command{Extensions -> Dock Sequence}
menu item.  First, a sequence should be assigned from a PIR file to a
particular chain-id and model number.  Secondly @command{Extensions ->
Dock Sequence -> Dock Sequence on this fragment@dots{}}.  Choose the
model to build on and then @command{Dock Sequence!} If all goes well,
the model will be updated with mutated residues and undergo rotamer
seach for each of the new residues.  If the sequence alignment is not
sufficiently clear, then you will get a dialog suggesting that you
extend or improve the fragment.

@node Rotamers
@section Rotamers
@cindex rotamers 

The rotamers are generated @footnote{since version 0.4} from the
backbone independent sidechain library of the Richardsons group
@footnote{SC Lovell, JM Word, JS Richardson and DC Richardson (2000)
"The Penultimate Rotamer Library" Proteins: Structure Function and
Genetics 40: 389-408.  You can get the paper from
@url{http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/databases/rotamer.php}}.

The m, t and p stand for ``minus (-60)'', ``trans (180)'' and ``plus
(+60)''.  There is one letter per @math{\chi} angle.

Use keyboard @key{.} and @key{,} to cycle round the rotamers.

@subsection Auto Fit Rotamer
@cindex auto-fit rotamer
``Auto Fit Rotamer'' will try to fit the
rotamer to the electron density.  Each rotamer is generated, rigid
body refined and scored according to the fit to the map.  Fitting the
second conformation of a dual conformation in this way will often fail
- the algorithm will pick the best fit to the density - ignoring the
position of the other atoms.

The algorithm doesn't know if the other atoms in the structure are in
sensible positions.  If they are, then it is sensible not to put this
residue too close to them, if they are not then there should be no
restriction from the other atoms as to the position of this residue -
the default is ``are sensible'', which means that the algorithm is
prevented from finding solutions that are too close to the atoms of
other residues. @code{(set-rotamer-check-clashes 0)} will stop this.


There is a scripting interface to auto-fitting rotamers:

@code{(auto-fit-best-rotamer @emph{resno alt-loc ins-code chain-id
imol-coords
imol-map clash-flag lowest-rotamer-probability})}

where:

@code{@emph{resno}} is the residue number

@code{@emph{alt-loc}} is the alternate/alternative location symbol
(@emph{e.g.} @code{"A"} or @code{"B"}, but most often @code{""})

@code{@emph{ins-code}} is the insertion code (usually @code{""})

@code{@emph{imol-coords}} is the molecule number of the coordinates molecule

@code{@emph{imol-map}} is the molecule number of the map to which
you wish to fit the side chains

@code{@emph{clash-flag}} should the positions of other residues be
included in the scoring of the rotamers (@emph{i.e.} clashing with other
other atoms gets marked as bad/unlikely)

@code{@emph{lowest-rotamer-probability}}: some rotamers of some side
chains are so unlikely that they shouldn't be considered - typically
0.01 (1%).


You can change the auto-fit rotamer fitting algorithms using

@code{(set-rotamer-search-mode @emph{mode})}
 
where @code{@emph{mode}} is one of @code{(ROTAMERSEARCHAUTOMATIC)},
@code{(ROTAMERSEARCHLOWRES)} (@emph{i.e.} "Backrub Rotamers"
(@emph{vide infra})) or @code{(ROTAMERSEARCHHIGHRES)} (the
conventional/high-resolution method using rigid-body fitting).

By default, the auto-fit rotamer method is @code{(ROTAMERSEARCHAUTOMATIC)}.

@subsubsection Backrub Rotamers
@cindex backrub rotamers
By default, Auto Fit Rotamer will switch to ``Backrub Rotamer''
@footnote{"The Backrub Motion: How Protein Backbone Shrugs
     When a Sidechain Dances" @emph{Structure}, Volume @b{14}, Issue 2, Pages
     265-274 I. Davis, W. Bryan Arendall III, D. Richardson, J. Richardson}
mode when fitting against a map of worse than 2.7@AA{}.  This
search mode moves the some atoms of the mainchain of the
neighbouring residues.  After rotation of the central residue and 
neighbouring atoms around the ``backrub vector'', the 
individual peptides are back-rotated (along the peptide axis) so that the
carbonyl oxygen are placed as near as possible to their original position.  
The Ramachandran plot is not used in this fitting algorithm.


@subsection De-clashing residues
Sometimes you don't have a map @footnote{for example, in preparation of
  a model for molecular replacement} but nevertheless there are
clashing residues
@cindex clashing residues 
 @footnote{atoms of residues
  that are too close to each other} (for example after mutation of a
residue range) and you need to rotate side-chains to a non-clashing
rotamer.  There is a scripting interface:

@code{(de-clash @emph{imol chain-id start-resno end-resno})}

@code{@emph{start-resno}} is the residue number of the first residue
you wish to de-clash

@code{@emph{end-resno}} is the residue number of the last residue
you wish to de-clash

@code{@emph{imol}} is the molecule number of the coordinates molecule

This interface will not change residues with insertion codes or
alternate conformation.  The
@code{@emph{lowest-rotamer-probability}} is set to 0.01.

@node Editing Chi Angles
@section Editing chi Angles
@cindex edit @math{\chi} angles
@cindex chi angles
Instead of using Rotamers, one can instead
change the @math{\chi} angles 
@cindex torsions 
(often called ``torsions'')
``by hand'' (using ``Edit Chi Angles'' from the ``Model/Fit/Refine''
dialog). To edit a residue's @math{\chi_1} press ``1'': to edit 
@math{\chi_2},
``2'': @math{\chi_3} ``3'' and @math{\chi_4} ``4''.  
Use left-mouse click and
drag to change the @math{\chi} value.  Use keyboard ``0'' @footnote{that's
  ``zero''.} to go back to ordinary view mode at any time during the
editing.  Alternatively, one can use the ``View Rotation Mode'' or use
the @key{Ctrl} key when moving the mouse in the graphics window.  Use the
Accept/Reject dialog when you have finished editing the @math{\chi} 
angles.

For non-standard residues, the clicked atom defines the base of the atom
tree, which defines the ``head'' of the molecule (it's the ``tail''
(twigs/leaves) that wags).  To emphasise, then: it matters on which atom
you click!

@c It should be emphasised that for standard residues this is an option
@c of last resort - use the other rotamer manipulation options first.

By default torsions for hydrogen atoms are turned off.  To turn them on:

@code{(set-find-hydrogen-torsions 1)}

To edit the rotatable bonds of a ligand using this tool, you will need
to have read in the mmCIF dictionary beforehand.

@node Torsion General
@section Torsion General
@cindex torsion general

   You need to click on the torsion-general button, then click 4 atoms
   that describe the torsion - the first atom will be the base (non
   moving) part of the atom tree, on clicking the 4th atom a dialog
   will pop up with a "Reverse" button.  Move this dialog out of
   the way and then left mouse click and drag in the main window will
   rotate the "top" part of the residue round the clicked atoms 2 and
   3.  When you are happy, click "Accept".

   If you are torsion generaling a residue that has an alt conf, then
   the atoms of residue that are moved are those that have the same alt
   conf as the 4th clicked atom (or have an blank alt conf).


@subsection Ligand Torsion angles
@cindex torsion angles, ligand 
@cindex ligand torsion angles
For ligands, you will need to read the mmCIF file that contains a
description of the ligand's geometry (see Section @ref{Regularization
and Real Space Refinement}).  By default, torsions that move hydrogens
are not included.  Only 9 torsion angles are available from the keyboard
torsion angle selection.

@node Pep-flip
@section Pep-flip
@cindex pepflip
@cindex flip peptide
Coot uses the same pepflip scheme
as is used in @code{O} (@emph{i.e.} the C, N and O atoms are rotated
180@math{^o} round a line joining the C@math{\alpha} atoms of the residues
involved in the peptide).  Flip the peptide again to return the atoms
to their previous position.

@node Adding Alternative Conformations
@section Add Alternate Conformation
@cindex  alternate conformation

The allows the addition alternate (dual,
@cindex dual conformations
triple @emph{etc.})  conformations to the picked residue.  By default,
this provides a choice of rotamer (Section @ref{Rotamers}).  If
there are not the correct main chain atoms a rotamer choice cannot be
provided, and Coot falls back to providing intermediate atoms.

The default occupancy for new atoms is 0.5.  This can be changed by
using use slider on the rotamer selection window or by using the
scripting function:

@code{(set-add-alt-conf-new-atoms-occupancy 0.4)}

The remaining occupancy of the atoms (after the new occupancy has been
added) is split amongst the atoms that existed in the residue before
the split.  It is important therefore that the residues atoms have
sane occupancies before adding an alternative conformation.

@c % The intermediate atoms interface can be forced using:

@c % @code{(set-show-alt-conf-intermediate-atoms 1)}

The default Split Type is to split the whole residue.  If you want the
default to be to split a residue after (and including) the CA, then add
to your @file{.coot} file:

@code{(set-add-alt-conf-split-type-number 0)}

@node Mutation
@section Mutation
@cindex mutate
Mutations are available on a 1-by-1 basis using the
graphics.  After selecting ``Mutate@dots{}'' from the
``Model/Fit/Refine'' dialog, click on an atom in the graphics.  A
``Residue Type'' window will now appear.  Select the new residue type
you wish and the residue in the graphics is updated to the new residue
type @footnote{Note that selecting a residue type that matches the
  residue in the graphics will also result in a mutation}.  The
initial position of the new rotamer is the @emph{a priori} most
likely rotamer. Note that in interactive mode, such as this, a residue
type match @footnote{@emph{i.e.} the current residue type matches the
  residue type to which you wish to mutate the residue} will not stop
the mutation action occurring.

@subsection Mutating DNA/RNA
@cindex mutating RNA
@cindex mutating DNA
@cindex RNA, mutating
@cindex DNA, mutating
Mutation of DNA or RNA can be performed using ``Simple Mutate'' from the
Model/Fit/Refine dialog.  Residues need to be named "Ad", "Gr", "Ur"
etc.  

@subsection Multiple mutations
This dialog can be found under @command{Calculate -> Mutate
  Residue Range}.  A residue range can be assigned a sequence and
optionally fitted to the map.  This is useful converting a poly-ALA
model to the correct sequence @footnote{@emph{e.g.} after using Ca
  -> Mainchain.}.

Multiple mutations
@cindex multi-mutate
 are also supported @emph{via}
the scripting interface.  Unlike the single residue mutation function,
a residue type match @emph{will} prevent a modification of the
residue @footnote{@emph{i.e.} the residue atoms will remain untouched}.
Two functions are provided: To mutate a whole chain, use
@code{(mutate-chain @emph{imol} @emph{chain-id sequence})} where:

@code{@emph{chain-id}} is the chain identifier of the chain that you wish
to mutate (@emph{e.g.} @code{"A"}) and 

@code{@emph{imol}} is molecule number.  

@code{@emph{sequence}} is a list of single-letter residue codes,
such as @code{"GYRESDF"} (this should be a straight string with no
additional spaces or carriage returns).

Note that the number of residues in the sequence chain and those in
the chain of the protein must match exactly (@emph{i.e.} the whole of
  the chain is mutated (except residues that have a matching residue
  type).)

To mutate a residue range, use 

@itemize
@item 
@code{(mutate-residue-range @emph{imol} @emph{chain-id}
  @emph{start-res-no} @emph{stop-res-no sequence})}
@end itemize

where

@code{@emph{start-res-no}} is the starting residue for mutation

@code{@emph{stop-res-no}} is the last residue for mutation, @emph{i.e.}
using values of 2 and 3 for @code{@emph{start-res-no}} and
@code{@emph{stop-res-no}} respectively will mutate 2 residues.

Again, the length of the sequence must correspond to the residue range
length.  Note also that this is a protein sequence - not nucleic acid.

For mutation of nucleic acids, use: 

@code{(mutate-nucleotide-range @emph{imol chain-id resno-start
      resno-end sequence})}

@subsection Mutating to a Non-Standard Residue

Sometimes one might like to model post-translational or other such
modifications.  How is that done, if the new residue type is not one of
the standard residue types?
 
There is a scripting function: 

@code{(mutate-by-overlap @emph{imol chain-id resno new-three-letter-code})}

This imports a model residue for the new residue type and overlays it on
to the given residue by using graph-matching to determine the equivalent
atoms.

The GUI for this can be found under @command{Extensions -> Modelling
-> Replace Residue...} (for this to work, you need to be centred on
the residue you wish to replace).

Note that if you are replacing are conventional protein residue with a
modified form (@emph{e.g.} replacing a TYR with a phoso-tyrosine or a
LYS with an acetyl-lysine) you will need to make sure that the group
of the resulting restraints is an @code{L-peptide} (use @command{Edit
-> Restraints} to check and modify the restraints group.  Likewise for
modified RNA/DNA nucleotides, you need to specify the group as
@t{RNA} or @t{DNA} as appropriate.


@subsection Mutate and Autofit
The function combines Mutation and Auto Fit Rotamer and is the easiest
way to make a mutation and then fit to the map.  You can currently only
``Mutate and Autofit'' protein residues (@emph{i.e.} things with a
rotamer dictionary.

@subsection Renumbering
@cindex renumbering residues 
Renumbering is straightforward using the
renumber dialog available under @command{Calculate ->
  Renumber Residue Range@dots{}}.  There is also a scripting interface:

@code{(renumber-residue-range @emph{imol chain-id start-res-no
    last-resno offset})}


@node    Importing Ligands/Monomers
@section Importing Lignds/Monomers
@cindex  monomers
@cindex  ligands

You can import monomers (often ligands) using @command{File -> Get
Monomer@dots{}}@footnote{this is a wrapper round LIBCHECK, so you must
have CCP4 suite to installed for this function to work} by providing
the 3-letter code of your monomer/ligand.  The resulting molecule will
be moved so that it placed at the current screen centre.

Typically, when you are happy about the placement of the ligand, you'd
then use @command{Merge Molecules} to add the ligand/monomer to the main
set of coordinates.

This procedure creates a pdb file @file{monomer-XXX.pdb} and a
dictionary file @file{libcheck_XXX.cif} in the directory in which Coot
was started.

A future invocation of Get Monomer uses these file so that the monomer
appears quickly @footnote{rather than running LIBCHECK again}.

@node    Ligand from SMILES strings
@section Ligand from SMILES strings
@cindex  SMILES strings

Similarly, you can generate ligands using @command{File -> SMILES...}
and providing a SMILES string and a code for the residue name (this is
your name for the residue type and a dictionary will be generated for
the monomer of this type). This function is also a wrapper to
LIBCHECK.


@node    Find Ligands
@section Find Ligands
@cindex ligands
You are offered a selection of maps to search (you can only choose one
at a time) and a selection of molecules that act as a mask to this
map.  Finally you must choose which ligand types you are going to
search for in this map @footnote{you can search for many different
ligand types.}.  Only molecules with less than 400 atoms are suggested
as potential ligands.

If you do not have any molecules with less that 400 atoms loaded in
Coot, you will get the message:

"Error: you must have at least one ligand to search for!"

New ligands are placed where the
map density is and protein (mask) atoms are @emph{not}).  The masked
map is searched for clusters using a default cut-off of 1.0@math{\sigma}.
In weak density this cut-off may be too high and in such a case the
cut-off value can be changed using something such as:

@code{(set-ligand-cluster-sigma-level 0.8)}

However, if the map to be searched for ligands is a difference map, a
cluster level of 2.0 or 3.0 would probably be more appropriate (less
likely to generate spurious sites).

Each ligand is fitted with rigid body refinement to each potential
ligand site in the map and the best one for each site selected and
written out as a pdb file.  The clusters are sorted by size, the
biggest one first (with an index of 0).  The output placed ligands
files have a prefix ``best-overall'' and are tagged by the cluster
index and residue type of the best fit ligand in that site.

By default, the top 10 sites are tested for ligands - to increase this
use:

@code{(set-ligand-n-top-ligands 20)}

@subsection Flexible Ligands
@cindex ligands, flexible
If the ``Flexible?'' checkbutton is activated, coot will generate a
number of variable conformations (default 100) by rotating around the
rotatable bonds (torsions).  Each of these conformations will be fitted
to each of the potential ligand sites in the map and the best one will
be selected (again, if it passes the fitting criteria above).

Before you search for flexible ligands you must have read the mmCIF
dictionary for that particular ligand residue type (@command{File
  -> Import CIF dictionary}).
@cindex dictionary, cif

Use:

@code{(set-ligand-flexible-ligand-n-samples @emph{n-samples})}

where @code{@emph{n-samples}} is the number of samples of flexibility
made for each ligand.  Generally speaking, The more the number of
rotatable bonds, the bigger this number should be.

By default the options to change these values are not in the GUI.  To
enable these GUI options, use the scripting function:

@code{(ligand-expert)}

@subsection Adding Ligands to Model
After successful ligand searching, one may well want to add that
displayed ligand to the current model (the coordinates set that
provided the map mask).  To do so, use Merge Molecules (Section
@ref{Merge Molecules}).


@node Flip Ligand
@section Flip Ligand
@cindex ligand orientation

Sometimes a ligand is placed more or less in the correct position, but
the orientation is wrong - or at least you might want to explore other
possible orientation.  To do that easily a function has been provided:

@code{(flip-ligand @emph{imol chain-id residue-number})}

This will flip the orientation of the residue around the Eigen vector
corresponding to the largest Eigen value, exploring 4 possible
orientations.

This function has been further wrapped to provide flipping for the active
residue: 

@code{(flip-active-ligand)}

This function can easily be bound to a key.


@node Find Waters
@section Find Waters
@cindex waters, finding
As with finding ligands, you are given a choice of maps, protein
(masking) atoms. A final selection has to be made for the cut-off level,
note that this value is the number of standard deviation of the density
of the map @emph{before} the map has been masked.  The default sigma
level (water positions must have density above this level) is set for a
``2Fo-Fc''-style map.  If you want to use a difference map, you must
change the sigma level (typically to 3 sigma) otherwise you run the risk
of fitting waters to difference map noise peaks.

Then the map is masked by the masking atoms and a search is
made of features in the map about the electron density cut-off value.
Waters are added if the feature is approximately water-sized and can
make sensible hydrogen bonds to the protein atoms.  The new waters are
optionally created in a new molecule called ``Waters''.

You have control over several parameters used in the water finding:

@code{(set-write-peaksearched-waters)} 

which writes @code{ligand-waters-peaksearch-results.pdb}, which
contains the water peaks (from the clusters) without any filtering and
@code{ligand-waters.pdb} which are a disk copy filtered waters that
have been either added to the molecule or from which a new molecule
has been created.

@code{(set-ligand-water-to-protein-distance-limits @emph{min-d max-d})} sets
the minimum and maximum allowable distances between new waters and the
masking molecule (usually the protein).  Defaults are 2.4 and 3.2@AA{}.

@code{(set-ligand-water-spherical-variance-limit @emph{varlim})} sets the
upper limit for the density variance around water atoms. The default
is 0.12.
@c % $electrons^2/@AA{}^6$.

The map that is marked by the protein and is searched to find the
waters is written out in CCP4 format as @code{"masked-for-waters.map"}.

@subsection Refinement Failure 

Sometimes as a result of water fitting, you may see something like:

@verbatim
 WARNING:: refinement failure
           start pos: xyz = (      17.1,     34.76,     60.42)
           final pos: xyz = (     17.19,     34.61,     60.59)
@end verbatim
 
When Coot finds a blob, it does a crude positioning of an atom at the
centre of the grid points.  It then proceeds to move to the peak of the
blob by a series of translations.  There are a certain number of
cycles, and if it doesn't reach convergence by the end of those cycles
then you get the error message.

Often when you go to the position indicated, you can see why Coot had a
problem in the refinement.

@subsection Blobs 
After a water search, Coot will create a blobs dialog (see Section
@ref{sec_blobs}).

@node Add Terminal Residue
@section Add Terminal Residue
@cindex terminal residue
This creates a new residue at the C or N terminal extension of the
residue clicked by fitting to the map.  @math{\phi,\psi} angle pairs
are selected at random based on the Ramachandran plot probability (for
a generic residue) and fitted to the density.  By default there are
100 trials.  It is possible that a wrong position will be selected for
the terminal residue and if so, you can reject this fit and try again
with Fit Terminal Residue @footnote{usually if this still fails after
two repetitions then it never seems to work.}. Each of the trial
positions are scored according to their fit to the map @footnote{The
map is selected using ``Refine/Regularize Control''} and the best one
selected.  It is probably a good idea to run ``Refine Zone'' on these
new residues.

If you use the Extensions (@command{Dock Sequence... -> Associate
Sequence with Model}) to apply a PIR sequence file to a model then
@command{Add Terminal Residue} will use the sequence alignment to
determine the residue type of the added residue.

Sometimes, particularly with low resolution maps, the added terminal
residue will wander off to somewhere inappropriate.  This can be
addressed in a number of ways:


@enumerate

@item 
@code{(set-terminal-residue-do-rigid-body-refine 0)} will disable
rigid body fitting of the terminal residue fragment for
each trial residue position (the default is 1 (on)) - this may help if
the search does not provide good results.

@item
to anneal the newly added residue back to the clicked residue (no
matter where it ended up being positioned):
@code{(set-add-terminal-residue-do-post-refine 1)}

@item
@code{(set-add-terminal-residue-n-phi-psi-trials 200)} will change the
number of trials (default is 100).  This is useful if you think that
Coot needs to search harder to find a good solution to the positioning
of the next residue.

@end enumerate

@node Add OXT Atom to Residue
@section Add OXT Atom to Residue

@cindex terminal oxygen
@cindex OXT atom
At the
C-terminus
@cindex C-terminus
of a chain of amino-acid residues, there
is a ``modification'' so that the C-O becomes a carbonyl, @emph{i.e.}
an extra (terminal) oxygen (OXT) needs to be added.  This atom is
added so that it is in the plane of the C@math{\alpha}, C and O atoms of
the residue.

Scripting usage:

@code{(add-OXT-to-residue imol residue-number insertion-code
  chain-id)} @footnote{@emph{e.g.} @code{(add-OXT-to-residue 0 428 "" "A")}}, 

where @code{insertion-code} is typically @code{""}.  

Note, in order to place OXT, the N, CA, C and O atoms must be present
in the residue - if (for example) the existing carbonyl oxygen atom is
called ``OE1'' then this function will not work.

@node Add Atom at Pointer
@section Add Atom at Pointer
By default, ``Add Atom At Pointer'' will pop-up a dialog from which
you can choose the atom type you wish to insert @footnote{including
  sulfate or phosphate ions (in such a case, it is probably useful to
do a ``Rigid Body Fit Zone'' on that new residue).}.  Using
@code{(set-pointer-atom-is-dummy 1)} you can by-pass this dialog and
immediately create a dummy atom at the pointer position.  Use an
argument of @code{0} to revert to using the atom type selection
pop-up on a button press.

The atoms are added to a new molecule called ``Pointer Atoms''.  They
should be saved and merged with your coordinates outside of Coot.

@node    Place Helix
@section Place Helix
@cindex helix placement

The idea is to place a helix more or less ``here'' (the screen centre)
by fitting to the electron density map.  The algorithm is
straightforward.  First we move to the local centre of density, then
examine the density for characteristic directions and fit ideal helices
(of length 20 residues) to these directions.  The helix is then extended
if possible (by checking the fit to the map of residues added in ideal
helix conformation) and chopped back if not.  If the fit is successful,
the helix is created in a new molecule called ``Helix''.  If the fit is
not successful, there is instead a message added to the status bar.  You
can build the majority of a helical protein in a few minutes using this
method (you will of course have to assemble the helices and assign
residue numbers and sequence later).

This is available as a scripting function @code{(place-helix-here)} and
in the GUI (in the ``Other Modelling Tools'' dialog).

@node    Building Ideal DNA and RNA
@section Building Ideal DNA and RNA
@cindex  DNA, ideal
@cindex  RNA, ideal
@cindex polynucleotides

The interface to building ideal polynucleotides can be found by
pressing the ``Ideal RNA/DNA@dots{}'' button on the ``Other Modelling
Tools'' dialog.

For a given sequence, a choice of DNA or RNA, A or B form, single or
double stranded is presented.  

The interface may not gracefully handle uracils in DNA, thymines in
RNA or B form RNA.

The ideal B-form DNA is somewhat under-wound, needing 11 base-pairs to
repeat (instead of the expected 10.5).  There is no easy fix for this
currently.



@node    Merge Molecules
@section Merge Molecules
@cindex merge molecules
The dialog for this opperation can be found under ``Calculate'' in the
main menubar.  This is typically used to add molecule fragments or
residues that are in one molecule to the ``working'' coordinates
@footnote{For example,
  after a ligand search has been performed.}.

The scripting interface is used like this

@code{(merge-molecules @emph{molecule-list} @emph{target-molecule})}

@emph{e.g.}

@code{(merge-molecules (list 1 2 ) 0)}

merges molecules 1 and 2 into molecule 0.

@node    Temperature Factor for New Atoms
@section Temperature Factor for New Atoms
@cindex  B-Factor, New Atoms

The default temperature factor for new atoms is 30.0.  This can be
changed by the following

@code{(set-default-temperature-factor-for-new-atoms 50.0)}

@node    Applying NCS Edits
@section Applying NCS Edits
@cindex  NCS edits

Let's imagine that you have 3-fold NCS.  You have molecule ``A'' as your
master molecule and you make edits to that molecule.  Now you want to
apply the edits that you made to ``A'' (the NCS master chain ID) to the
``B'' and ``C'' molecules (i.e. you want the ``B'' and ``C'' molecules
to be rotated/translated versions of the ``A'' molecule).  How is that
done?

There are now guis to NCS command to help you out (under Extensions).
However, for completeness here are the scripting versions:

@code{(copy-from-ncs-master-to-others @emph{imol} @emph{master-chain-id})}

If you have only a range of residues, rather than a whole chain to replace:

@code{(copy-residue-range-from-ncs-master-to-others @emph{imol} 
        @emph{master-chain-id start-resno end-resno})}

e.g.

@code{(copy-residue-range-from-ncs-master-to-others 0 "A" 1 5)}

If you want to copy a residue range to a specific chain, or specific
list of chains (rather than all NCS peer chains) then make a list of
the chain-ids that you wish replaced:

@code{(copy-residue-range-from-ncs-master-to-chains 0 "A" 1 5 (list "C"))}

in this case, just the residues in the "C" chain is replaced.


@node    Running Refmac
@section Running Refmac 
@cindex refmac
@cindex running refmac

Use the ``Run Refmac@enddots{}'' button to select the dataset and the
coordinates on which you would like to run Refmac.  Note that here Coot
only allows the use of datasets which has Refmac parameters set as the
MTZ file was read. By default, Coot displays the new coordinates and the
new map generated from refmac's output MTZ file.  Optionally, you can
also display the difference map.

You can add extra parameters 
@cindex refmac parameters
(data lines) to
refmac's input by storing them in a file called
@code{refmac-extra-params} in the directory in which you started
coot.

You can also provide extra/replacement parameters for refmac by setting
the variable @code{refmac-extra-params} to a list of strings, for
example:

@code{(set! refmac-extra-params (list "REFINE MATRIX 0.1" "MAKE HYDROGENS NO"))}


Coot ``blocks'' @footnote{@emph{i.e.} Coot is idle and ignores all
  input.} until Refmac has terminated @footnote{This is not an ideal
  feature, of course and will be addressed in future@enddots{}. Digressive
  Musing: If only computers were fast enough to run Refmac
  interactively@dots{}}.

The default refmac executable
@cindex refmac, default 
@cindex default refmac executable 
is @code{refmac5} it is presumed to be in the
path.  If you don't want this, it can be overridden using a
re-definition either at the scripting interface or in one's
@code{~/.coot} file @emph{e.g.}:
@itemize
@item @code{(define refmac-exec "/e/refmac-new/bin/refmac5.6.3")}
@end itemize

@cindex refmac map colour
After running refmac several times, you may
find that you prefer if the new map that refmac creates (after refmac
refinement) is the same colour as the previous one (from before this
refmac refinement).  If so, use:

@code{(set-keep-map-colour-after-refmac 1)}

which will swap the colours of then new and old refmac map so that the
post-refmac map has the same colour as the pre-refmac map and the
pre-refmac map is coloured with a different colour.

@node    Running SHELXL
@section Running SHELXL 
@cindex SHELXL
@cindex running SHELXL

Coot can read shelx @t{.res} files and write @t{.ins} files, and thus
one can refine using SHELXL in a convenient manner using the function 

@code{(shelxl-refine @emph{imol} . @emph{hkl-file-name})}

(the @code{@emph{hkl-file-name}} is an optional argument)

@emph{e.g.}

@code{(shelxl-refine 0)}

or 

@code{(shelxl-refine 0 "insulin.hkl")}

In the former case, coot will presume that there is a SHELX @t{hkl} file
corresponding to the @t{res} file that you read in; if there is not coot
will print a warning and not try to run shelxl.  In the latter case, you
can specify the location of the @t{hkl} file.

After shelxl has finished, coot will automatically read in the resulting
@t{res} coordinates, the @t{fcf} file, convert the data to @t{mmCIF}
format and read that, which generates a @math{\sigma_A} map and a
difference map.  

Coot creates a time stamped @t{ins} file and a time-stamped sym-link to
the @t{hkl} file in the @code{coot-shelxl} directory.


Please note that
the output @t{ins} file will not be particularly useful (and thus shelxl
will fail) if the input file was not in SHELX @t{ins} format.

There is a GUI for this operation under the ``Extensions'' menu item.

@node    Clear Pending Picks
@section Clear Pending Picks
@cindex  Clear Pending Picks
@cindex atom picking 
Sometimes one can click
on a button @footnote{such that Coot would subsequently expect an atom
  selection ``pick'' in the graphics window.} unintentionally. This
button is there for such a case.  It clears the expectation of an
atom pick.  This works not only for modelling functions, but also
geometry functions (such as Distance and Angle).

@node    Delete
@section Delete 
@cindex delete 

Single atoms or residues can be deleted from the molecule using
``Delete@dots{}'' from the ``Model/Fit/Refine''dialog.  Pressing this
button results in a new dialog, with the options of ``Residue'' (the
default), ``Atom'' and ``Hydrogen Atoms''.  Now click on an atom in the
graphics - the deleted object will be the whole residue of the atom if
``Residue'' was selected and just that atom if ``Atom'' was selected.
Note that if a residue has an alternative conformation, then ``Delete
Residue'' will delete only the conformation that matches that
alternative conformation specifier of the clicked atom.

Only waters are deletable if the "Water" check button is active and
waters are not deletable if the "Residue/Monomer" check button is
active.  This is to reduce mis-clicking.

To rotate the view when in ``Delete Mode'', use Ctrl left-mouse.

If you want to delete multiple items you can use check the ``Keep Delete
Active'' check-button on this dialog This will will keep the dialog
open, ready for deletion of next item.

@c document delete-atom, delete-residue, delete-residue-with-altconf here.

An atom can be delete using the scripting

@code{(delete-atom @emph{imol chain-id residue-no ins-code atom-name alt-conf})}

Residues can be deleted using the scripting

@code{(delete-residue @emph{imol chain-id residue-no ins-code})}

Residue ranges can be deleted using the scripting

@code{(delete-residue-range @emph{imol chain-id residue-no-start residue-no-end})}

Chains can be deleted using the scripting

@code{(delete-chain @emph{imol chain-id})}

Sidechains can be deleted from a region:

@code{(delete-side-chain-range @emph{imol chain-id residue-no-start residue-no-end})}

or for a chain

@code{(delete-sidechains-for-chain @emph{imol chain-id})}

@node    Sequence Assignment 
@section Sequence Assignment 
You can assign a (FASTA format) sequence to a molecule using:

@code{(assign-fasta-sequence imol chain-id fasta-seq)}

This function has been provided as a precursor to functions that will
(as automatically as possible) mutate your current coordinates to one
that has the desired sequence. It will be used in automatic side-chain
assignment (at some stage in the future).

@node    Building Links and Loops
@section Building Links and Loops

Coot can build missing linking regions or loops
@footnote{the current single function doesn't always perform very well
in tests}. The function can be found under  @command{Calculate -> Fit Loop -> Fit Loop by Rama Search} 
or the scripting function:

@code{(fit-gap @emph{imol} @emph{chain-id} @emph{start-resno} @emph{stop-resno})}

and 

@code{(fit-gap @emph{imol} @emph{chain-id} @emph{start-resno} @emph{stop-resno} @emph{sequence})}

the second form will also mutate and try to rotamer fit the provided sequence.

Example usage: let's say for molecule number 0 in chain @code{"A"}
we have residues up to 56 and then a gap after which we have residues
62 and beyond:

@code{(fit-gap 0 "A" 57 61 "TYPWS")}

@node    Fill Partial Residues
@section Fill Partial Residues
@cindex  fill partial residues

After molecular replacement, the residues of your protein could well
have the correct sequence but be chopped back to CG or CB atoms. There
is a function to fill such partially-filled residues:

@code{(fill-partial-residues @emph{imol})}

This identifies residues with missing atoms, then fills them and does a
rotamer fit and real-space refinement.

If you want to fill the side chain of just one residue

@code{(fill-partial-residue @emph{imol chain-id res-no ins-code})}

this does a auto-fit-best-rotamer and a refinement on the resulting
side-chain position.


@node Changing Chain IDs
@section Changing Chain IDs
@cindex chain id
@cindex changing chain ids

You can change the chain ids of chains using @command{Calculate ->
Change Chain IDs@dots{}}.  Coot will block an attempt to change the
whole of a chain and the target chain id already exists in the
molecule.  

If you use the "Residue Range" option then you can insert residues
with non-conflicting residue number into pre-existing chains.


@node    Setting Occupancies
@section Setting Occupancies
As well as the editing ``Residue Info'' to change occupancies of
individual atoms, one can use a scripting function to change
occupancies of a whole residue range:

@itemize 
@item @code{(zero-occupancy-residue-range @emph{imol chain-id 
resno-start resno-last})}
@end itemize

example usage:

@code{(zero-occupancy-residue-range 0 "A" 23 28)}

This is often useful to zero out a questionable loop before submitting
for refinement.  After refinement (with refmac) there should be
relatively unbiased density in the resulting 2Fo-Fc-style and
difference maps.

Similarly there is a function to reverse this operation:

@itemize
@item @code{(fill-occupancy-residue-range @emph{imol chain-id 
      resno-start resno-last})}
@end itemize


@node    Fix Nomenclature Errors
@section Fix Nomenclature Errors

Currently this is available only in scripting form:

@code{(fix-nomenclature-errors @emph{imol})}

This will fix atoms nomenclature problems in molecule number
@code{@emph{imol}} according to the same criteria as WATCHECK
@footnote{R.W.W. Hooft, G. Vriend, C. Sander, E.E. Abola, Errors in
protein structures.  @emph{Nature} (1996) @strong{381}, 272-272.}
@emph{e.g.} Chi-2 for Phe, Tyr, Asp, and Glu should be between -90 and
90 degrees.  Note that Val and Leu nomenclature errors are also corrected.


@node    Rotamer Fix Whole Protein
@section Rotamer Fix Whole Protein
       
There is an experimental scripting function

@code{(fit-protein @emph{imol})}

which does a auto-fit rotamer and Real Space Refinement for each
residue.  The graphics follow the refinement.


@node    Refine All Waters 
@section Refine All Waters 

All the waters in a model can be refined (that is, moved to the local
density peak) using

@code{(fit-waters @emph{imol})}

This is a non-interactive function (the waters are moved without user
intervention).


@node Moving Molecules/Ligands
@section Moving Molecules/Ligands
@cindex moving molecules
@cindex moving ligands

Often you want to move a ligand (or some such) from wherever it was read
in to the position of interest in your molecule (@emph{i.e.} the current view
centre).  There is a GUI to do this: @command{Calculate -> Move Molecule
Here}.

There are scripting functions available for this sort of thing:

@code{(molecule-centre @emph{imol})} 

will tell you the molecule centre 
@cindex molecule centre
 of the
@code{@emph{imol}}th molecule.

@code{(translate-molecule-by @code{imol x-shift y-shift z-shift})}

will translate all the atoms in molecule @code{@emph{imol}} by the
given amount (in @AA{}ngstr@"{o}ms).
@cindex translate molecule

@code{(move-molecule-to-screen-centre @emph{imol})}

will move the @code{@emph{imol}}th molecule to the current centre of
the screen (sometimes useful for imported ligands).  Note that this
moves the atoms of the molecule - not just the view of the molecule.

@node    Modifying the Labels on the Model/Fit/Refine dialog
@section Modifying the Labels on the Model/Fit/Refine dialog
@cindex  modified labels

If you don't like the labels "Rotate/Translate Zone" or "Place Atom at
Pointer" and rather they said something else, you can change the button
names using:

@code{(set-model-fit-refine-rotate-translate-zone-label "Move Zone")}

and

@code{(set-model-fit-refine-place-atom-at-pointer "Add Atom")}

@node Maps in General
@section Maps in General 
Maps are ``infinite,'' not limited to pre-calculated volume (the
``Everywhere You Click - There Is Electron Density''
(EYC-TIED)
@cindex EYC-TIED
paradigm) symmetry-related electron
density is generated automatically. Maps are easily re-contoured.
Simply use the scroll wheel on you mouse to alter the contour level
(or -/+ on the keyboard).
@cindex change contour level
 
Maps follow the molecule.  As you recentre or move about the crystal,
the map quickly follows.  If your computer is not up to re-contouring
all the maps for every frame, then use @command{Draw ->

@subsection Map Reading Bug
Unfortunately, there is a bug in map-reading.  If the map is not a
bona-fide CCP4 map @footnote{@emph{e.g.} it's a directory or a
coordinate filename.}, then coot will crash.  Sorry.  A fix is in the
works but ``it's complicated''.  That's why maps are limited to the
extension ".ext" and ".map", to make it less likely a non-CCP4 map is
read.

@node    Create a Map
@section Create a Map 
From MTZ, mmCIF and .phs
@cindex PHS data format
data use @command{File -> Open MTZ, CIF or phs@dots{}}. You can then
choose the MTZ columns for the Fourier synthesis.  The button ``Expert
mode'' also adds to the options any anomalous columns you may have in
the MTZ file (a -90 degree phase shift will be applied).  It also
provides the option to apply resolution limits.

From a CCP4
map use @command{File -> Read Map}.  After being
generated/read, the map is immediately contoured and centred on the
current rotation centre.


@subsection Auto-read MTZ file
This function allows Coot to read an MTZ file and make a map directly
(without going through the column selection procedure).  The default
column labels for auto-reading are "FWT" and "PHWT" for the 2Fo-Fc-style
map, "DELFWT" and "PHDELWT" for the difference map.  You can change the
column labels that Coot uses for auto-reading - here is an example of
how to do that:

@code{(set-auto-read-column-labels "2FOFCWT" "PHIWT" 0)}
@code{(set-auto-read-column-labels "FOFCWT" "DELPHIWT" 1)}

By default the difference map is created in auto-reading the MTZ file.
If you don't want a difference map, you can use the function:

@code{(set-auto-read-do-difference-map-too 0)}

@subsection Reading CIF data
There are several maps that can be generated from CIF files that
contain observed Fs, calculated Fs and calculated phases:

@itemize 
@item @code{(read-cif-data-with-phases-fo-alpha-calc
    @emph{cif-file-name})} Calculate an atom map using @math{F_obs} and
    @math{\alpha_calc}
@item @code{(read-cif-data-with-phases-2fo-fc @emph{cif-file-name})}
 Calculate an atom map using @math{F_obs}, @math{F_calc} and
  @math{\alpha_calc}
@item @code{(read-cif-data-with-phases-fo-fc @emph{cif-file-name})}
 Calculate an difference map using @math{F_obs}, @math{F_calc} and
  @math{\alpha_calc}.
@end itemize

@subsection Reading PHS data
@cindex PHS data

There are 2 ways to read data by scripting:

@code{(read-phs-and-make-map-using-cell-symm @emph{phs-file-name space-group-name a b c alpha beta gamma})}

@code{(read-pdb-and-make-map-with-reso-limits @emph{imol-previous phs-file-name reso-limit-low reso-limit-high})}

The first specifies the cell explicitly, and @code{@emph{alpha, beta}}
and @code{@emph{gamma}} are specified in degrees. 

The second form allows the specification of resolution limits and takes
the cell and symmetry from a previous molecule (typically a pdb file).

@node    Map Contouring
@section Map Contouring
@cindex contouring, map
Maps can be re-contoured using the middle-mouse
scroll-wheel (buttons 4 and 5 in X Window System(TM)
@c $^{\textrm{\tiny TM}}$
terminology).  Scrolling the mouse wheel will change the map contour
level and the map it redrawn.  If you have several maps displayed then
the map that has its contour level changed can be set using
@command{HID -> Scrollwheel -> Attach scroll-wheel
  to which map?}.  If there is only one map displayed, then that is
the map that has its contour level changed (no matter what the
scroll-wheel is attached to in the menu).  The level of the electron
density is displayed in the top right hand corner of the OpenGL canvas.

Use keyboard @key{+} or @key{-} to change the contour level if you don't
have a scroll-wheel @footnote{like I don't on my Mac.}.

If you are creating your map from an MTZ file, you can choose to click
on the ``is difference map''
@cindex difference map
button on the Column
Label selection widget (after a data set filename has been selected)
then this map will be displayed in 2 colours corresponding to + and -
the map contour level.

If you read in a map and it is a difference map then there is
a checkbutton to tell Coot that.

If you want to tell Coot that a map is a difference
map
@cindex difference map colours
after it has been read, use:

@code{(set-map-is-difference-map @emph{imol})}

where @code{@emph{imol}} is the molecule number.

By default the change of the contour level is determined from the sigma
of the map.  You can change this in the map properties dialog or by
using the scripting function:

@code{(set-contour-by-sigma-step-by-mol @emph{step on/off? imol})}

where 

@code{@emph{step}} is the difference in sigma from one level to the next
(typically 0.2)

@code{@emph{on/off?}} is either 0 (sigma stepping off) or 1 (sigma stepping on)

By default the map radius @footnote{actually, it's a box.} is 10@AA{}.
The default increment to the electron density depends on whether or
not this is a difference map (0.05 @math{e^-/\AA^3} for a ``2Fo-Fc''
style map and 0.005 @math{e^-/\AA^3} for a difference map).  You can
change these using @command{Edit -> Map Parameters} or by
using the ``Properties'' button of a particular map in the Display
Control (Display Manager) window.

@node Map Extent
@section Map Extent
@cindex map extent
@cindex map box radius

The extent of the map can be set using the GUI (@command{Edit -> Map
Parameters -> Map Radius}) or by using the scripting function,
@emph{e.g.}:

@code{(set-map-radius 13.2)}

@node    Map Contour ``Scrolling'' Limits
@section Map Contour ``Scrolling'' Limits
Usually one doesn't want to look at 
@cindex negative contour levels
negative contour levels of a map@footnote{in a coot
  difference map you will get to see the negative level contoured at
  the inverted level of the positive level, what I mean is that you
  don't want to see the ``positive'' level going less than 0.}, so
Coot has by default a limit that stops the contour level going beyond
(less than) 0.  To remove the limit:

@code{(set-stop-scroll-iso-map 0)} for a 2Fo-Fc style map

@code{(set-stop-scroll-diff-map 0)} for a difference map

To set the limits to negative (@emph{e.g.} -0.6) levels:

@code{(set-stop-scroll-iso-map-level -0.6)}

and similarly: 

@code{(set-stop-scroll-diff-map-level -0.6)}

where the level is specified in @math{e^-/\AA^3}.

@node Map Line Width 
@section Map Line Width 
@cindex map line width 
@cindex density line thickness 
@cindex thickness of density lines
The width of the lines that describe the density can
be changed like this:

@code{(set-map-line-width 2)}

The default line width is 1.

@node     Map colouring 
@section ``Dynamic'' Map colouring 
@cindex colouring, map
 By default, maps get coloured according to
their molecule number.  The starting colour (@emph{i.e.} for molecule
0) is blue.  The colour of a map can be changed by @command{Edit
  -> Map Colour..}. The map colour gets updated as you
change the value in the colour selector @footnote{takes you right back
  to the good old Frodo days, no?}.  Use ``OK'' to fix that colour.

As subsequent maps are read, they are coloured by rotation round a
colour wheel.  The default colour map step is 31 degrees.  You can
change this using:

@code{(set-colour-map-rotation-for-map @emph{step})}

@node    Difference Map Colouring
@section Difference Map Colouring
For some strange reason, some crystallographers @footnote{Jan Dohnalek,
  for instance.} like to have their difference maps coloured with red
as positive and green as negative, this option is for them:

@code{(set-swap-difference-map-colours 1)}

This option will allow the ``blue is positive, red is negative'' colour
scheme on ``Edit -> Map Colour''.


@node    Make a Difference Map
@section Make a Difference Map
@cindex difference map

Using the ``Make a Difference Map'' function in the Extensions menu, one
can make a difference from two arbitrary maps.  The maps need not be on
the same griding, or in the same space group even.  The resulting map
will be on the same griding and space group as the ``Reference'' map.

@node    Make an Averaged Map
@section Make an Averaged Map
@cindex average map

There is a scripting interface to the generation of map averages.  As
above, the maps need not be on the same grid or in the same space group.
The resulting map will have the same gridding and space group as the
first map in the list.  Typical usage:

@code{(average-map '((1 1.0) (2 1.0))))}

The argument to @code{(average-map} is a list of lists, each list
element is a list of the map number and a weighting factor (1.0 in this
case).


@node    Map Sampling
@section Map Sampling
By default, the Shannon sampling factor is the conventional 1.5.  Use
larger values (@command{Edit -> Map Parameters ->
  Sampling Rate}) for smoother maps @footnote{a value of 2.5 is often
  sufficient.}.

This value can be set by the scripting command

@code{(set-map-sampling-rate 2.5)}

@node    Dragged Map 
@section Dragged Map 
By default, the map is re-contoured at every frame during a drag (Ctrl
Left-mouse).  Sometimes this can be annoyingly slow and jerky so it is
possible to turn it off: @command{Draw -> Dragged Map
  -> No}.

To change this by scripting:

@code{(set-active-map-drag-flag 0)}

@node Dynamic Map Sampling and Display Size
@section Dynamic Map Sampling and Display Size 
If activated (@command{Edit -> Map Parameters ->
  Dynamic Map Sampling}) the map will be re-sampled on a more coarse grid
when the view is zoomed out.  If ``Display Size'' is also activated,
the box of electron density will be increased in size also.  In this
way, you can see electron density for
@cindex big maps
big maps (many
unit cells) and the graphics still remain rotatable.

If you want to have these functions active for all maps, add the
following to your initialization file @ref{Scheme}:

@code{(set-dynamic-map-sampling-on)}
@code{(set-dynamic-map-size-display-on)}

@node Skeletonization
@section Skeletonization
@cindex skeletonization
@cindex bones
The skeleton (also known as
``Bones'' @footnote{If you're living in Sweden@enddots{} or Captain Kirk, that
  is.}) can be displayed for any map.  A map can be skeletonized using
@command{Calculate -> Map Skeleton@dots{}}.  Use the option
menu to choose the map and click ``On'' then ``OK'' to the generate
the map (the skeleton is off by default).

The level of the skeleton can be changed by using @command{Edit
  -> Skeleton Parameters@dots{} ->
  Skeletonization Level@dots{}} and corresponds to the electron density
level in the map.  By default this value is 1.2 map standard
deviations.  The amount of map can be changed using @command{Edit
  -> Skeleton Parameters@dots{} -> Skeleton Box
  Radius@dots{}}@footnote{you may think it strange that a box has a
  radius, this is an idiosyncrasy of Coot.}.  The units are in 
@AA{}ngstr@"{o}ms, with 40 as the default value.

The skeleton is often recalculated as the screen centre changes - but
not always since it can be an irritatingly slow calculation.
@cindex skeleton updating
If you want to force a regeneration of
the displayed skeleton, simply centre on an atom (using the middle
mouse button) or press the @key{S} key.

@node Map Sharpening
@section Map Sharpening
@cindex sharpening, map

It can be educational (even useful at lower resolutions)
to sharpen or blur a map.  This can be achieved with the sharpening
tool @command{Calculate -> Map Sharpening@dots{}}.  By default, the
maximum and minimum sharpness is +/- @math{200@AA{}^2}, this can be
changed (in this case to 300) using:

@command{(set-map-sharpening-scale-limit 300)}

This currently only works on maps created by reading an MTZ (or other)
reflection data file.

@node Pattersons
@section Pattersons
@cindex Patterson

Pattersons can be generated using the @code{make-and-draw-patterson}
function.  Example usage:

@code{(make-and-draw-patterson @emph{mtz-file-name f-col sig-f-col})}

where @code{@emph{use-weights-flag}} is either @code{0} or @code{1}.

@emph{e.g.}

@code{(make-and-draw-patterson "native.mtz" "FP_nat" "SIGFP_nat")}

@node Map Re-Interpolation
@section Map Re-Interpolation
@cindex map re-Interpolation

Maps can be re-interpolated to match a reference map.

@code{(reinterp-map @emph{map-no reference-map-no})}

will create a copy of  @code{@emph{map-no}} in the same cell, spacegroup and grid spacing as  
the @code{@emph{reference-map-no}} map.


@node masks
@section Masks
@cindex masks
A map can be masked by a set of coordinates. Use the
scripting function: 

@code{(mask-map-by-molecule @emph{imol-map} @emph{imol-model} @emph{invert-mask?})}

If @code{@emph{invert-mask?}} is 0, this will create a new map that has
density only where there are no (close) coordinates.  If
@code{@emph{invert-mask?}} is 1 then the map density values will be set
to zero everywhere @emph{except} close to the atoms of molecule number
@emph{imol-model}.

The radius of the mask around each atom is 2.0@AA{} by default.  You can
change this using:

@code{(set-map-mask-atom-radius @emph{radius})}

There is a GUI interface to Map Masking under the Extensions menu. 

@subsection Example 
If one wanted to show just the density around a ligand:

@enumerate
@item Make a pdb file the contains just the ligand and read it in to
  Coot - let's say it is molecule 1 and the ligand is residue 3 of
  chain ``L''.
@item Get a map that covers the ligand (@emph{e.g.} from refmac).
  Let's say this map is molecule number 2.
@item Mask the map:

@code{(mask-map-by-molecule 2 1 1)}

This creates a new map.  Turn the other maps off, leaving only the
masked map.

@end enumerate

To get a nice rendered image, press F8 (see Section @ref{Raster3D}).

@node Trimming Atoms
@section Trimming 
@cindex trimming atoms
If you want to remove all the atoms @footnote{or set their occupancy to
  zero} that lie ``outside the map'' (@emph{i.e.} in low density) you can use

@code{(trim-molecule-by-map @emph{imol-coords imol-map density-level delete/zero-occ?})}

where @code{@emph{delete/zero-occ?}} is @code{0} to remove the atoms and
@code{1} to set their occupancy to zero.

There is a GUI interface for this feature under the ``Extensions'' menu
item.

@node    Map Transformation
@section Map Transformation
@cindex  map transformation

If you want to transform a map, you can do it thusly:

@code{(transform-map @emph{imol} @emph{rotation-matrix} @emph{trans} @emph{point radius})}

where:

@code{@emph{rotation-matrix}} is a 9-membered list of numbers for an orthogonal rotation matrix.

 @code{@emph{trans}} is a 3-membered list of numbers (distances in @AA{}ngst@"{o}ms).

 @code{@emph{point}} is a 3-membered list of numbers (centre point in @AA{}ngst@"{o}ms).

 @code{@emph{radius}} is a single number (also in @AA{}ngst@"{o}ms).


This applies the rotation @code{@emph{rotation-matrix}} and a
translation @code{@emph{trans}} to a map fragment, so that when the
transformation is applied the centre of the new map is at
@code{@emph{point}}.  

Example usage:

@code{(transform-map 2 '(1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1) '(0 0 1) (rotation-centre) 10)}

which transforms map number 2 by a translation of 1@AA{} along the Z
axis, centred at the screen centre for 10@AA{} around that centre.

Here's a more real-world example:

Let's say we want to tranform the density over the ``B'' molecule to a
position over the ``A'' molecule. First we do a LSQ transformation to
get the rotation and translation that moves the ``B'' coordinates over
the ``A'' coordinates:

In the terminal output we get:

@verbatim
|    0.9707,    0.2351,   0.05033|
|  -0.04676,      0.39,   -0.9196|
|   -0.2358,    0.8903,    0.3896|
(    -33.34,     21.14,     18.82)
@end verbatim

The centre of the ``A'' molecule is at (58.456, 5.65, 11.108).  So we do:

@code{(transform-map 3 (list 0.9707 0.2351 0.05033 -0.04676 0.39 -0.9196
-0.2358 0.8903 0.3896) (list -33.34 21.14 18.82) (list 58.456 5.65
11.108) 8)}

Which creates a map over the middle of the ``A'' molecule.  Note that
using a too high @code{@emph{radius}} can cause overlap problems, so try
with a small @code{@emph{radius}} (@emph{e.g.} 5.0) if the resulting map
looks problematic.

Alternatively, instead of typing the whole matrix, you can use a
coordinates least-squares fit to generate the matrix for you.
@code{(transform-map-using-lsq-matrix)} does just that.

Heres how to use it:

@code{(transform-map-using-lsq-matrix @emph{imol-ref ref-chain
ref-resno-start ref-resno-end imol-mov mov-chain mov-resno-start
mov-resno-end imol-map about-pt radius})}


Hopefully the arguments are self explanatory (@code{@emph{ref}} refers
to the reference molecule, of course and @code{@emph{about-pt}} is a
3-number list such as is returned by @code{(rotation-centre)}).

We can now export that map, if we want.


@node Export Map
@section Export Map
@cindex write map
@cindex export map

You can write out a map from Coot (e.g. one from NCS averaging, or
masking or general transformation) using the export map function:

@code{(export-map @emph{imol} @emph{filename})}

@emph{e.g.}

@code{(export-map 4 "ncs-averaged.map")}

@node    Ramachandran Plots
@section Ramachandran Plots
@cindex Ramachandran plot

Ramachandran plots are ``dynamic''.  When you edit the molecule
(@emph{i.e.} move the coordinates of some of atoms) the Ramachandran
plot gets updated to reflect those changes.  Also the underlying
@math{\phi/\psi} probability density changes according to the selected
residue type (@emph{i.e.} the residue under the mouse in the plot).
There are 3 different residue types: GLY, PRO, and not-GLY-or-PRO
@footnote{the not-GLY-or-PRO is the most familiar
  Ramachandran plot.}.

When you mouse over a representation of a residue (a little square or
triangle @footnote{prolines have a grey outline rather than a black
  one, triangles are glycines.}) the residue label pops up.  The
residue is ``active'' @emph{i.e.} it can be clicked.  The ``graphics''
view changes so that the C@math{\alpha} of the selected residue is centred.
In the Ramachandran plot window, the current residue is highlighted by
a green square.

The underlying distributions are taken from the Richardson's Top500
structures @url{http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/databases/top500.php}.

The probability levels for acceptable (yellow) and preferred (red) are
0.2% and 2% respectively.

You can change the contour levels:

@code{(set-ramachandran-plot-contour-levels 0.025 0.003)}

You can change the ``blocksize'' (the default is 10 degrees) of the
contours using

@code{(set-ramachandran-plot-background-block-size 5)}

These comes into effect when a new plot is created (it doesn't change
plots currently displayed).


@node Geometry Analysis
@section Geometry Analysis

A restraints-based geometry analysis of the molecule.  The distortion
is weighted by atom occupancy. The distortion of the geometry due to
links is shared between the contributing residues.

Note that only the first model of a multi-model molecule is analysed.


@node Chiral Volumes
@section Chiral Volumes
The dictionary is used to identify the chiral atoms of each of the
model's residues.  A clickable list is created of atoms whose chiral
volume in the model is of a different sign to that in the dictionary.

During refinement and regularization, Coot will pop-up dialogs warning
about chiral volume errors - if you have them.  This can be annoying
@footnote{but that's partly the idea, I suppose.}. You can inhibit this
dialog like this:

@code{(set-show-chiral-volume-errors-dialog 0)}


@subsection Fixing Chiral Volume Errors

There are two obvious ways:

1) mutate and auto-fit rotamer (mutate it to the residue type that it is)

2) RS Refine the residue and invert the chiral centre by pulling an
atom. Usually you can pull the CA to the other side of the plane made
by the chiral neighbouring atoms (using ctrl left-click).  Sometimes
giving the CB a good old tweak is the easier way.

Inverting the CB of THR is easier, just move the OG so that the plane
of the neighbours is on the other side of the CB (again with ctrl
left-click).


@node sec_blobs
@section Blobs: a.k.a. Unmodelled density
This is an interface to the Blobs
@cindex blobs 
@cindex unmodelled density
dialog.  A map and a set of coordinates that model the
protein are required.

A blob is region of relatively high residual election density that
cannot be explained by a simple water.
@cindex unexplained density 
So, for example, sulfates, ligands, mis-placed sidechains or unbuilt
terminal residues might appear as blobs.  The blobs are in order, the
biggest  @footnote{and therefore most interesting} at the top.

@node     Difference Map Peaks
@section  Difference Map Peaks

This is one of the fastest ways to validate a model and its data
(presuming that the difference map comes from a post-refinement
mFo-DFc map).  It highlights regions where the model and the data do
not agree.

Lesser peaks within a certain distance (by default, 2.0@AA{}) of a
large peak are not shown.  This cuts down on the number of times one
is navigated to a particular region because of ripple or other noise
peaks around a central peak. 

This value can be queried:

@code{(difference-map-peaks-max-closeness)}

and adjusted:

@code{(set-difference-map-peaks-max-closeness 0.1)}


@node Check Waters by Difference Map
@section Check Waters by Difference Map

Sometimes waters can be misplaced - taking the place of sidechains or
ligands or crystallization agents such as phosphate for
example @footnote{or the water should be more properly modelled as
  anistrotropic or a split partial site}.  In such cases the variance
of the difference map can be used to identify these problems.

This function is also useful to check anomalous maps.  Often waters
are placed in density that is really a something else, perhaps a
cation, anion, sulphate or a ligand.  If such an atom diffracts
anomalously this can be identified and corrected.

By default the waters with a map variance greater than 3.5@math{\sigma}
are listed.  One can be more rigorous by using a lower cut-off:

@code{(set-check-waters-by-difference-map-sigma-level 3.0)}

The scripting interface is: 

@code{(check-waters-by-difference-map @emph{imol-coords}
  @emph{imol-diff-map})}

where @code{@emph{imol-coords}} is the molecule number of the
coordinates that contain the waters to be checked

@code{@emph{imol-diff-map}} is the molecule number of the difference
map (it must be a difference map, not an ``ordinary'' map).  This
difference map must have been calculated using the waters. So there is
no point in doing this check immediately after ``Find Waters''.  You
will need to run Refmac or some other refinement first first
@footnote{and remember to check the difference map button in the ``Run
Refmac'' dialog}.

@node    Molprobity Tools Interface
@section Molprobity Tools Interface
@cindex  Molprobity Tools
@cindex  probe
@cindex  reduce

The molprobity tools @file{probe} and @file{reduce} have been
interfaced into Coot (currently, the interface is not as slick as it
might be).  However, the tools are useful and can be used in the
following way:

first we need to tell Coot where to find the relevant executables
(typically you would add the following lines to you @file{~/.coot}
file):

@code{(define *probe-command* "/path/to/probe/executable")}

@code{(define *reduce-command* "/path/to/reduce/executable")}
 
now the probe hydrogens and probe dots can be generated using
@command{Validate -> Probe Clashes} (or in the Scripting Window):

@code{(probe @emph{imol})}

where @code{@emph{imol}} is the molecule number of coordinates to be
probed.  A new molecule with Hydrogens is created (by @file{reduce}) and
read in.

By default Coot creates a new molecule for the molecule that now has
hydrogens.  To change this:

@code{(set! reduce-molecule-updates-current #t)}

and that, as you can guess, replaces, rather than adds to the
``probed'' molecule.

This gives a "static" view of the molecule's interactions.

To get a dynamic view (which is currently only enabled on rotating chi
angles) add these to your @file{~/.coot} file:

@code{(set-do-probe-dots-on-rotamers-and-chis 1)}

To get a semi-static view (dots are regenerated in the region of zone
after a "Real Space Refinement"):

@code{(set-do-probe-dots-post-refine 1)}


@node GLN and ASN B-factor Outliers
@section GLN and ASN B-factor Outliers
@cindex  GLN and ASN B-factor Outliers

It is often difficult to detect by eye the correct orientation of the
amino-carbonylo group of GLN and ASNs.  However, we can use (properly
refined) temperature factors to detect outliers.  We take the Z value as
half the difference between the B-factor of the NE2 and OE1 divided by
the standard deviation of the B-factors of the rest of the residue.  An
analysis of GLNs and ASNs of high resolutions structures indicates that
a Z value of greater than 2.25 indicates a potential (if not probable)
flip.  A ``Fix'' button is provided in the resultant dialog make this
easy to do.

This analysis was added after discussions with Atsushi Nakagawa and so
is called ``Nakagawa's Bees''.

The analysis does not check residues with multiple conformations.

@node Validation Graphs
@section Validation Graphs 
@cindex  Validation Graphs 

Coot provides several graphs that are useful for model validation (on
a residue by residue basis): residue density fit, geometry distortion,
temperature factor variance, peptide distortion and rotamer analysis.

@subsection Residue Density Fit 

The density fit graph shows the density fit for residues.  The score
is the average electron density level at the atom centres of the atoms
in the residue.  The height of the blocks is inversely proportional to
the density average.

The residue density fit is by default scaled to a map that is
calculated on the absolute scale.  Sometimes you might be using a map
with density levels considerably different to this, which makes the
residue density fit graph less useful.  To correct for this you can
use the scripting function:

@code{(set-residue-density-fit-scale-factor @emph{factor})}

where @code{@emph{factor}} would be @math{1/(4* rmd_{map})} (as a rule
of thumb).

@code{(residue-density-fit-scale-factor)} returns the current scale
factor (default 1.0).

There is also a GUI to this: 

@command{Extensions -> Refine@dots{} -> Set Density Fit Graph Weight@dots{}}

@subsection Rotamer Analysis 
Residue rotamers are scored according to the prior likelihood.  Note
that when CD1 and CD2 of a PHE residue are exchanged (simply a
nomenclature error) this can lead to large red blocks in the graph
(apparently due to very unlikely rotamers).  There are several other
residues that can have nomenclature errors like this.  To fix these
problems use 

@code{(fix-nomenclature-errors @emph{imol})}

@subsection Temperature Factor Variance 

This idea is from Eleanor Dodson, who liked to use the standard
deviation of a residue's temperature factors to highlight regions of
questionable structure.

Note that Hydrogens are ignored in this analysis.

@subsection Peptide Omega Angle Distortion

Some variability of the @math{\omega} is to be expected in the peptide
bond.  But not too much. Anything more than 13 degrees is suspicicous.
Unexpected peptide bonds show up red by default.  If cis peptides
@emph{are} to be expected, and should not marked as bad, then you can
tell this to Coot using:

@command{Edit -> Preferences -> Geometry -> Cis-Peptides -> No}

@c @subsection Geometry


@c @menu
@c * Pukka Puckers?::
@c @end menu

@c This checks the the bonds, angles and planes geometry of the model is
@c consistent with the dictionary @footnote{the Refmac dictionary, that
@c is}.  The block size is correlated with the geometry distortion and the
@c tooltip tells you the most distorted geometrical feature in the residue.
@c A ``plane'' distortion can refer to the peptide plane.

@c @node Pukka Puckers?
@c @subsection Pukka Puckers?
@c @cindex  Pukka Puckers?

@c A pucker checker has been incorporated into Coot after the method
@c described in their Molprobity paper @footnote{Davis @emph{et al.} (2007)
@c Molprobity: all atom contacts and structure validation for proteins and
@c nucleic acids, Nucleic Acids Research @b{35}, W375-W383}. Davis @emph{et
@c al.} note that the distance of phosphate atom of the following residue
@c out of the plane of the base is strongly correlated with the ribose
@c pucker.  Coot checks that the out of plane distance is consistent with
@c the ribose pucker (and let's you know if it is not).

@node Surfaces
@section Surfaces

Coot uses the surface code from Gruber and Noble (2004).

Coot uses the partial charges of the atoms (the @var{partial_charge}
field in the @var{_chem_comp_atom} block) from the charge dictionary item
in the refmac (or other) cif dictionary.  However, partial charges are
only used under certain conditions

1) the molecule consists of less than 100 atoms

or 

2) the number of atoms in the molecule that are hydrogens is at least
15% of the total number of atoms in the molecule

If partial charges are not used, then the fall-back is to use charges
from side-chains charged at physiological pH (Arg, Lys, Asp, Glu).

@node    Coot Droppings
@section Coot Droppings
@cindex  coot droppings
@cindex  droppings

This describes the files and directory that coot leaves behind after it
has been fed (sorry, I mean ``used'').  Everything except the
@t{0-coot.state.scm} state file can comfortably be deleted if needed
after coot has finished.

@cindex guano
You can stop the state and history files being written if you start coot
with the @code{--no-guano} option.

@itemize
@item @t{0-coot.state.scm}  The most important file.  This contains the state of 
        coot when you last exited. It contains things like which molecules  
        were read, the maps, the colours of the molecules and map, the screen 
        centre, map size and so on.  When restarting a coot session, this file
        should usually be used.  

@item @t{0-coot-history.scm} The history of coot commands you used in your last 
        coot session in scheme format.  Incomplete history.  One day this will be 
        a complete history of the session suitable for uploading into a database 
        describing the model modification.

@item @t{0-coot-history.py} The history of coot commands you used in your last 
        coot session in python format.

@item @t{coot-download} directory where the files downloaded from the network (e.g. 
        from the EBI and EDS) go.

@item @t{coot-backup} Each model modification generates the saving of coordinates 
        as a pdb file in this directory.

@item @t{coot-refmac} When running REFMAC using the Coot interface, the input to 
        refmac and the output go in this directory.

@item @t{coot-molprobity} When running Molprobity's Probe and Reduce using the Coot
         interface, the input and output go in this directory.

@node    Clearing Backups
@section Clearing Backups
@cindex  clearing backups
@cindex  backups, clearing

Coot will occasionally ask you to clear up the @file{coot-backup}
directory.  You can adjust the behaviour in a number of ways:

@itemize
@item @code{(define *clear-out-backup-run-n-days* 3)} will run the backup clearance every 3 days (the default is every 7).
@item @code{(define *clear-out-backup-old-days* 1)} will clear out files older then 1 day (rather than the default 7 days).
@item You can create your own version of the function that is run on exiting Coot:
   @code{(clear-backups-maybe)}
@end itemize

So, if you wanted to clear out everything more than 1 day old, every
time, without Coot asking you about it:

@smalllisp
(define *clear-out-backup-run-n-days* 0)
(define *clear-out-backup-old-days* 1)
(define (clear-backups-maybe) 
  (delete-coot-backup-files 'delete)
  (coot-real-exit 0))
@end smalllisp


@node Getting out of ``Translate'' Mode 
@section Getting out of ``Translate'' Mode 
If you get stuck in "translate" mode in the GL canvas (@emph{i.e.} mouse
does not rotate the view as you would expect) simply press and release
the Ctrl key to return to "rotate" mode.

@node    Getting out of ``Continuous Rotation'' Mode
@section Getting out of ``Continuous Rotation'' Mode

The keyboard @key{I} key toggles the ``continuous rotation'' mode.  The
menu item @command{Draw -> Spin View On/Off} does the same thing.

@node Label Atom Only Mode
@section Getting out of ``Label Atom Only'' Mode
Similarly, if you are stuck in a mode where the ``Model/Fit/Refine''
buttons don't work (the atoms are not selected, only the atom gets
labelled), press and release the Shift key.

@node Button Labels
@section Button Labels 
Button labels ending in ``@dots{}'' mean that a new dialog will pop-up
when this button is pressed.

@node sec_picking 
@section Picking 
@cindex picking 
Note that left-mouse in the 
graphics window is used for both atom picking and rotating the view,
so try not to click over an atom when trying to rotate the view when
in atom selection mode.  

@node    Resizing View

Several of the parameters of Coot are chosen
because they are reasonable on my ``middle-ground'' development
machine.  However, these parameters can be tweaked so that slower
computers perform better:

@itemize 
@item @code{(set-use-stroke-characters 1) ; default is to use bitmap characters }
@item @code{(set-smooth-scroll-steps 8) ; default 40 }
@item @code{(set-smooth-scroll-limit 30) ; Angstroms}
@item @code{(set-residue-selection-flash-frames-number 3);}
@item @code{(set-skeleton-box-size 20.0) ; A (default 40).}
