Have you really filled the vertices and indices?

Call this before setup():
   gtk_gl_area_attach_buffers(GTK_GL_AREA(graphics_info_t::glareas[0]));

If you don't then, there will be a crash on glDrawElements() or glDrawArrays().

Use() the shader in setup().

In setup():
   glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
   glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);
   glEnableVertexAttribArray(2);

   And set the offsets correctly for glVertexAttribPointer(), e.g.:
   glVertexAttribPointer(2, 4, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, sizeof(s_generic_vertex),
                         reinterpret_cast<void *>(2 * sizeof(glm::vec3)));

   Attribute 2 has size 4.

In draw():
   glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
   glEnableVertexAttribArray(1);
   glEnableVertexAttribArray(2);

In draw():
   Don't forget to send over the mvp:
   glUniformMatrix4fv(shader.mvp_uniform_location, 1, GL_FALSE, &mvp[0][0]);

   1: After I had filled balls, I didn't call
      im.update_instancing_buffers(balls);

   2: I was iterating over meshes, but trying to draw instanced meshes (this won't happen again
      hopefully)

   3: I was using the wrong shader, not moleculestotriangles.shader, not instanced-objects.shader
      (that one contains an orientation in the attributes - I don't need that for balls)
      rama-balls.shader is what I wanted (is that true for other instanced meshes in the future
      though? Hmm) So the balls were the wrong colour and drawn at the origin.

    Are the any vertices?

    Are the vertices in the same place?

    For object in the world but facing the camera, use the transpose of the view rotation matrix.
    e.g. in particles.shader or lines-pulse.shader
