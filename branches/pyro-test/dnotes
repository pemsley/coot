   How about some flexibility in file name output?

     How difficult is it to create (or, maybe, How would one go about
     creating a) naming system for output PDB files that is consonant
     with my usage?  Currently COOT gives a default of
     input_file_name-coot-0.pdb.  I typically name my files
     model_0i.pdb for the file out of refinement (before ligand, hence
     the zero -- yes I do it too ;-) ) and my first output file as
     model_0o1.pdb.  If I do some "editing" outside of COOT, I might
     then create model_0i2.pdb and if I make some changes inside COOT,
     the output file would be model_0o2.pdb, etc.  After the next
     cycle of refinement, I would come in with model_1i.pdb, etc.

	Note to self:

	B factor average, variance vs resolution for each residue type.

	Probably best to have a shell script to provide the pdb files
	
	c++ program reads pdbs and does b-factor analysis, 

            on completion appends to files "ARG.tab" "ASP.tab" etc
            with average and variance for each residue of that type in
            that pdb file.  Also the resolution.

	    only do 1 chain of each pdb file.

            use Coot libs - make it a Coot program.

    We shall use a std::vector<line_representation> line_rep_vec;  
    New items are pushed back.  You can't delete an item from this
    vector, mearly not display it (the handles are passed back - and
    we don't want them to go out of date).

    Particular alt confs cannot be selected for.

    Questions:  How shall we create new represenations for this molecule?

    // return 
    int add_representation imol represenation-spec

    // used by GUI
    undisplay_represenation imol respresentation-number

    undisplay_represenation imol residue_spec
    which needs to be unambiguated. Test in this order:

     o Was there a line_representation that has that residue_spec?
     o Was there a residue_range line_representation that encompassed that residue_spec?
     o Was that residue in a chain that has a line_representation?

"My view is that I don't want to see all 3 of these in the list, one would do. "

   In ligand fitting, I want to see the scores and the positions of
   the best fits in the other orientations.  The B factors should be
   set to the ligand fit score for this testing.  Perhaps the ligand
   fitting should return a vector of std::pair<name, mol>s.  Best fit,
   ori1, ori2, etc.

   So maybe set a developer option to do this.

   Residue info should also contain phi psi values and a percentile
   (like molprobity)

   How about a graph of Ramachandran percentile?

    How To Add Another Geometry Graph
  
    in geometry_graphs.hh:
    --------------------------
    Add new type to geometry_graph_type 

    in geometry_graphs.cc
    --------------------------
    In the coot::geometry_graphs::geometry_graphs(...) constructor, add title

    in graphics-info-graphs.cc
    --------------------------
    graphics_info_t::update_geometry_graphs(...) 
    Add a function to update new graph.

      coot::geometry_graphs *gr =
	 geometry_graph_dialog_to_object(residue_density_fit_graph[imol_moving_atoms]);
	 std::vector<coot::geometry_graph_block_info_generic> dv =
	    geomtry_graph_xxx_from_mol(moving_atoms_asc_local,
				 imol_moving_atoms,
				 Imol_Refinement_Map());
	 gr->update_residue_blocks(dv);

    Create a function:
    void graphics_info_t::xxx_graphs(int imol)...


    in c-interface-xxx.cc
    ----------------------
      void validation_graph_XXX_mol_selector_activate (GtkMenuItem     *menuitem,
						      gpointer         user_data);
   in main.cc
   ----------
   Add create_initial_validation_graph_submenu_generic
   The menu name (the first string) must match the names generated by the glade

   in callbacks.c
   --------------
  char *type = "density-fit";
  GtkWidget *menu = lookup_widget(GTK_WIDGET(menuitem), "density_fit_analysis1");
  if (menu) { 
    add_on_validation_graph_mol_options(menu, type);
  } else { 
    printf("failed to get menu in on_density_fit1_activate\n");
  }
    
   in c-interface-validate.cc
   -------------------------

   Add another option to add_on_validation_graph_mol_options()

   The validation_type must match that from callbacks.c
   The sub_menu_name must match that from main.cc 
     create_initial_validation_graph_submenu_generic()

   Also unset_geometry_graph(GtkWidget *dialog) needs to know about the new graph

   in graphics_info_graphs.cc 
   --------------------------
   set_validation_graph need to know about the new graph

    Really test out Ca Zone -> Mainchain.  

    It seems to me that most of the time it works well, but there are
    regions where it does not. e.g. CA - N bonds of less than 0.5A.
    I am thinking that that can only be coming from a bug.

    Now I am compiling gtk2+ becuase the system gtk2+ on cycle (FC4)
    is too old to complile Coot.

    I am doing it on cycle in ~/compile
    I created setup pango-glib-gtk2 with PKG_CONFIG settings.
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4

    glib 2.12.13 straightforward
    pango 1.16.4 straightforward
    fine.  
    Oh for gtk2 though, cairo is not an option.  It is a must.  Baah.
    That was not clear in www.gtk.org.

    So get cairo 1.4.14 from http://cairographics.org/releases/

    which means get glitz from http://cairographics.org/snapshots/
    (gotta have glitz, right?)

    glitz-0.5.6 
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    back to cairo
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4 --enable-glitz
    This displays a warning about using glitz, but configures OK.
    Compiles OK.

    back to pango:
    now with cairo in place, pango's configure finds cairo
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    back to Gtk2+:
    glib version test failed, so need to add LD_LIBRARY_PATH too (to the setup file)
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    Fine.  But Coot configure fails on gtlglExt

    http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gtkglext/gtkglext-1.2.0.tar.gz?modtime=1139081517&big_mirror=1
    back to GtkGLExt:
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Compiles OK.

    Coot now compiles OK.  And runs! Great.
    But - it doesn't load svgs.

    OK, back-up. 

    config.log for cairo tells us we need a newer librsvg:
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/librsvg/2.20/
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/librsvg/2.20/librsvg-2.20.0.tar.gz (2 days old at 
    time of writting)

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/autobuild/Linux/Coot-0.4
    Warns us that we are not compiling with libcroco.
    Oh well.

    OK, now librsvg is in place configure finds it.
    Rebuilding cairo
    Install.

    Fine.  Now coot loads its svgs.  Yay!

    PyGtk needs pycairo


    Correct build order:
    glitz
    glib
    librsvg
    cairo
    pango
    gtk+-2
    glkglext

Hmm...


checking for LIBRSVG... configure: error: Package requirements (        gdk-pixbuf-2.0 >= 1.3.7         glib-2.0 >= 2.12.0      libxml-2.

Requested 'pangoft2 >= 1.2.0' but version of Pango FT2 is 1.1.1

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/cairo.html

  Note that the GTK, Poppler and librsvg packages are circular in that
  using them for test suite coverage requires installing cairo first,
  then installing the desired package(s), then installing cairo again.

 Use cluster volume vs contour threshhold plot (of the difference map)

    Frank: 

   "torsion general - crappy tail?"  I think I meant: why can't one
   use torsion general to swing a whole lot of protein around a main
   chain bond?  If I try, the mouse just clears after the 4th click.
   i.e., all I can move around is a miserable little tail of a
   sidechain, maybe.  Oh wait, I see now: yes, torsion general works
   only inside a residue.  Which is a bit anal, what if I want to
   swivel a whole domain or helix when it's changed from the MR model.
   Other place of nuisance: when modelling around in poor density at
   the end of a chain.

   "Ramachandran boundaries".  Ah yes: any reason why you don't have
   the same smooth boundaries that Richardsons use?  I've seen cases
   just outside your boundaries, but happily inside the Richardson
   one.

   "Views file: #Views".  Yes, the views file coot writes out itself
   doesn't load back.  Reason is (I remember) that the second (or
   third line) contains #Views, which screws up scheme.

   "Save coords: most recently changed".  Oh yes: could you populate
   the defaults (molecule; filename) based on the file most recently
   changed, and not on the one currently active?  These are not always
   the same, and chances are I want to save what I just built at, not
   what I was looking at.

Randy Read: 
Some time back I sent you a bug report about split-screen stereo.  Don't know 
if you've been able to reproduce it, but since then I've worked out the 
problems.  Basically, coot doesn't like the "Side by Side (Wall Eyed)" option 
any more.  Part of the problem is the saved state.  If the saved state is 
Mono or normal "Side by Side", then you're fine -- coot comes up the way you 
left it.  (Don't know about hardware, as I don't have access to an 
appropriate machine.)  If the saved state is "Side by Side (Wall Eyed)", then 
Draw -> Stereo... brings up a box claiming that you're still in that mode, 
but the view is a mono one.  The only way to get wall-eyed stereo from this 
state is to click "Mono" then "Side by Side" then finally "Side by Side (Wall 
Eyed)".  If you come up in Mono mode, you also can't go directly to 
wall-eyed -- first you have to go into normal side-by-side mode.

Lothar Esser

I am using coot 0.5 pre 958 and noticed that after resizing the
window of the ramachandran plot and possibly zooming in (with the
right mouse) the scroll bars don't allow to pan over the plot. Only
under extreme zoom, the scroll bars allow a little bit of
adjustment. I have over 2000 residues and need to zoom and scroll a
bit if I want to click on residues.

I do get error messages on the
terminal that might help:

** CRITICAL **: file gtk-canvas.c: line 3518
** (gtk_canvas_set_pixels_per_unit): a ssertion `n >
** GTK_CANVAS_EPSILON' failed.

The same message repeats presumably every
time I scroll(?) or perphas zoom.

Also, I noticed after a long search that the -key zooms out after I
had zoomed in with the right-mouse. Could zooming out be added to the
mouse perhaps like Shift-right-mouse ?

Another feature of coot would be good: Show ramachandran plots by
chains that the user select i.e. a plot with one chain at a time.

  Sugar puckers

     RNA sugar pucker (C3' endo or C2' endo) is strongly correlated to
     the perpendicular distance between the following (3') phosphate
     and either the plane of the base or the C1'-N1/9 glycosidic bond
     vector. Incorrectly chosen sugar puckers also often result in
     out-of-range values for the epsilon dihedral. This is important
     information, because a sugar pucker is very difficult to
     determine directly from the electron density at resolutions
     typical for large RNAs. MolProbity checks epsilon angles and
     checks the modeled sugar pucker against the base-phosphate
     distance; it flags outliers as potentially having the wrong
     pucker.

    Fun: How about a script to make ray traced images of ligands at

    have different ligands).  Need to find structures with data of
    course.  Consider using j-multi-read, get the matrices and apply
    them to their maps.  Maybe that is not needed, because we are not
    going to look at the overlapped maps anyway, just ligands in the
    binding sites.

    Data needs to be formatted differently in the
    text control file - we need a specification of the mtz file and
    column labels too.

	It's not the algorithms

   After the release, there are no pre-release source tars, so the
   build web page builder fails (a list-ref of a #f list)

   Python 2.5.2 build tests are failing with sendmail on FC5 (after
   re-install?)

   Crash on CentOS 4 machines when trying to read svgs

   Trying to separate python build logs from non-python build
   logs. Problems! overlapping dependencies, test the tar file and
   transfer it - many fixes to sort out.

   Coot builds on 32 and 64 bit systems.  In which directory should
   the libraries go?  By convention, 32 bit libs in prefix/lib and 64
   bit libs in prefix/lib64.  How is this sorted out in the configure?
   Buy using an autoconf macro AC_LIB_PREPARE_MULTILIB.  Where is this
   provided? In a recent version of gettext (more recent that fink
   currently provides).  So on every build system we have to get (e.g
   from the pre-build package e.g. Ubuntu intrepid) or downlaod and
   install gettext manually and point the autogen (that run aclocal and
   autoconf) to use the macros in the files installed from gettext.

   I wanted to check that the torsions in ligand conformation were
   being correctly set.  I needed a function therefore to return a
   torsion to the scripting level - given a set of atom specifiers.
   So first a wrote a test that tested that the torsion generation
   function worked - did it fail properly when the (some of) the atoms
   were not correctly specified (i.e. not in the molecule).  When that
   was working, I could write a test to do the ligand fitting and
   check the torsions of the best fitting (hopefully correctly
   fitting) model.

   Frank:

     This one is quicker: are you able to colour text in the Display

     the map objects coloured according to map type, e.g. blue for
     sigmaA map, red for difference map (info you can infer from the
     mtz?), and even green for other maps (usually
     experimental/averaged).

   JB et al: 

   Copy fragment 2bz1 //B/1-305  -> no atoms selected 

   Make the image type png

   Don't display bumps - in the environment distances (so that
   biologist see the hydrogen bonds - but not the bumps (the are not
   interested in them)).

   Unphosphorylate (change the residue type)

   Add a key binding to cut side chains (shift K, perhaps).

* Done.

   Perhaps the hydrogens on a ligand from probe is not working as
   you'd hoped.  Try with several different ligands.  See "Use
   write_connectivity to generate ligand hydrogens" in the rel-todo.

   Then you will need to use the hydrogen conn file when running
   reduce.

   It is reasonble for me to say he period is 0 and the sd is 0 on a
   rotatable bond.  So coot should deal with that.   

      i.e. if the sd is 0, then no torsion restraint on that tor.
       also if the period is 0, there souold ben no torsion
       restraints.

   The weight matrix refinement control dialog needs to be read/set.

   We want button in the main toolbar to open a coordinaes file (so
   that we dont have to click and hold and select a menu item on the
   file men (Word does it).  Same for cif and mtz.  We need to make
   the open_coords_dialog() acceccesable from scripting.

   split residue (his) and rotamers (try both from CA, and all). 

   Try rotamers on a alt confed residue.

   Delete a water (shift W).

   On adding a water, it defaults to adding to "Waters molecule" or
   something - stop doing that and if it is default/not assigned, then
   give me a dialog to assign it

   Somehow go to reside "GTY" (let me type a triple letter).

   The sequence alignement seems to fail, because lets say the protein
   starts with residue 11, the sequence alignemnt should be for the
   model, not the sequence.  Needs investigating.

   Residues with missing atoms: I want to use the . and , key on the
   generated list.

   Same goes for the list from Find Waters.  I want a list of waters
   in a dialog that I can use . and , with. Like questionable waters.

   Backrub rotamer search on a PHE in a helix.  -> terrible solution.
   Need to include clash terms. 

   User-define-click resets the cursor after it has run the
   function. This can be inconvenient, when user-defined-click calls
   itself at the end (e.g. we don't know how many times
   user-defined-click needs to be called - so we use it in one-by-one
   mode)

   Try sphere refinement with hydrogens on. Check that convergence
   happens.

   "SSM all" to this: give me a dialog, with an "all on" button.  

   chains ligands
   A        D
   B        E
   C        F

   SSM-all should copy across the ligands too - that is what we are
   most interested in. You will have to find which ligands should come
   with which chains.

   NCS ghosts don't work with ligands/cofacors.  Can you make it work
   with those too?

   There should be quick way to undo/undisplay "highight intereting
   residue"

   Make an uberfile with views, maps, proteinm models in it.

   align vs pir sequence failed to do anything obvious.
   We then dis alignment-mismatches-gui by hand and it gave us a gui.

   An "Insert residue" should take you to the nearest residue.
  
   But the residue number is wrong for insertions.
   Mutations look fine.

   In the colour map rotation for maps, let there be "an allowed range"
   on the colour wheel).

     I want a function to set the refinment weight for me,

     Keep doing that with different weights until we get to 1.0.

* Scheduled.

     The very low level map from phenix, makes refinement fail to 
     converge without setting the map weight to 3000!

 Change the probe radius you can see potential interactions at longer distnaces.

	Project student idea: In refining RNA, it would be nice to
	have extra restraints to keep the base planes aligned.  This
	could be done with a combination of angle and plane (pseudo)
	restraints as a mmCIF link.  Write a program to generate these
	from a PDB file.  You'll need a wiggle-room factor.  Maybe
	generate an intermediate representation/file that the user can
	optionally edit and generate the dictionary from that.

Garib: 08/01/09


  If top/par file could be converted to the following type of
  instructions then you do not need to define everything in cif file
  (these are for torsion angles, all other restraints can be defined
  similarly)

  General torsion angle restraints for any quartet of atoms:

  external torsion first chain [ch] residue [res] insertion [ins] atom
  [n] [altecode [a]] next chain [ch] residue [res] insertion [ins]
  atom [n] [altecode [a] ] [symm y/n] next chain [ch] residue [res]
  insertion [ins] atom [n] [altecode [a] ] next chain [ch] residue
  [res] insertion [ins] atom [n] [altecode [a] ]
 [symm y/n] value <v> sigma <s> period> <p>

  Exampl

  external torsion first chain A residue 220 atom C next chain A
  residue 220 atom CA next chain A residue 220 atom C next chain A
  residue 221 atom N value -60 sigma 10 period 1

   It would be nice if coot::util::model_sequence() (or its argument -

   Ingo K: if you try to add a c-terminal residue, coot does recognize
   the residue number correctly, but will not do any real space
   refinement. if you output the coordinates, you will see that the
   new residue is attached to the end of the B chain, i.e. BEHIND the
   waters.  i would guess that this breaks real space refinement in

   CResidue *residue_p =
      graphics_info_t::molecules[imol].get_residue(resno, ins_code, chain_id);
   if (residue_p) {
      coot::residue_spec_t spec(residue_p);
      g.delete_residue_from_geometry_graphs(imol, spec);
   }

   This needs to be rationalised into (perhaps) 
   delete_residue_from_geometry_graphs_maybe(chain_id, resno, ins_code);

    An extension to backrub rotamer: 

    For each rotamer: try chi-by-chi to improve the fit to the density
    of the side chain.  It will probably only need 2 rounds.  Needs
    non-trivial minimiser though (having said that, it's only a series
    of 1-d functions).

    score wil be relatively low and ignorable?

Ed Pozharski:

   Coot severely slows down the system when I try to generate the
   density fit graph using multi-model (NMR-style) pdb file.  First,
   it apparently generates as many dialogs as there are models, yet
   every graph has multiple bars (which is not very useful since they
   are overlapping).  Computer becomes unresponsive for some time, but
   when it comes back everything is very slow (except that I can
   rotate and zoom in smoothly, things get slow if I re-centre).

   The problem appears to be that coot eats a lot of RAM under these
   circumstances.  I have 4Gb here and it's still not enough so
   machine starts using the swap and thus gets very-very slow.
   Interestingly, most of the extra RAM is owned by Xorg, not coot,
   and is not freed even when I exit (but it is when I log out).

   If I load the same number of models as individual pdb-files, I can
   generate multiple density fit graphs with virtually undetectable
   increase in memory use.

     sqrt(sum(delta_rho2)/Npoints)/sigma(rho), where delta_rho is a
     grid-point value in a 2(mFo-DFc) map, the sum is over the region
     of interest (atom, residue, side-chain etc), Npoints is the
     number of grid points in the region, and sigma(rho) is the
     uncertainty in the density (which must be estimated for the
     asymmetric unit of the map, NOT just the region).  Note that it's
     equivalent to the negative log-likelihood, which IMO is the
     appropriate statistic for this situation, if it's assumed that
     the errors in the density have a normal distribution.

If that won't do, a trivial function to fix occs of given alt conf can
be made by wrapping set-atom-attributes

    Here is how to run molprobity probe for just the interactions of
    environment onto the ligand (and vica versa):

    (No internal interaction of ligand)

   Here residue 459 is the ligand:

   probe -u -both "459" "not 459" 2gpu-A459.pdb 2gpu-coot-0.pdb > probe.dots

   Do this after running reduce of course (so that the Hs are pointing
   in good directions).

  On pressing Esc during refinement: 

	Can we have a dialog box pop up summarizing the geometry and
	asking us to accept/reject instead of reverting back? 
	Sometimes a real space refine takes too long/gets lost when
	the best fit to the density is observed before that happens.

   How about this: map the surface of a protein onto a cylinder, 

   Then unwrap the cylinder and display as a 2d plot.

   Do that for both sides of an interface.

   or mutant vs native.

   so we will need some way to mark the surface of atom selection.

    after changing the interface, e.g. c-interface.h

    you will probably need to do:
    an install in scheme
    an install in python
    run swig to make new coot.py
    an install in src, to update installed coot.py

    Mutate and autofit to an MSE should change the atoms to HETATM,
    but it does not.

    So, minimol's atom class needs 'bool is_hetatm' flag.  

    Import: minimol's residue constructors from CResidue * need to set
    the is_hetatm flag by testing at->Het.

    Extraction: When constructing the pcmmdbmanager(), we need to set
    at->Het = true when making the CAtom *.
