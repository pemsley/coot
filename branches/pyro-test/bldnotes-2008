* TO DO THINGS *
---------------

   o additional representations: hide parts of model (use bond thickness 0?!?

   o revisit python sockets

   o merge build-it-win with buid-it-gtk2-simple?!

   o test vista compositing (* Done?!?!)

   o povray view angle still not ok (view gets smaller the further away from 
	 origin we are)

   o refmac to run from an XML file

   o read_refmac_log to read refmac XML output (if there)

   o ribbons from aesop python things from CCP4MG (at some point)

   o use libglade

   o cootaneering (more testing, make documentation?)

   o alternatives for loop building (wait for Kevin's implementation)

   o add terminal residue (if Gly, Pro) use different target ramachandran
	 function for placement of term residue;
	 maybe we want to try general rama first, then Pro, then Gly (if we 
	 dont know the residue type) for better loop fit (or in general)
	 this may require some Gly noise filtering as Gly always will fit best

   o side chain treatment in low res maps (test if torsion angle restraints 
	 are good enough) otherwise we may want different weight for MC and SC
	 and/or B-factor refinement

   o fragment fitting/search

   o rsync builds to Paul's dir

   o fix threading in python 'Coot News'

   o How about interfacing to a Wii?

   o "Check for updates" button? (need to know which OS we are on, maybe 
     from the install dir?!)

   o read_shelx ins file:
	 does it remove comments correctly? (! comment) from line!!!!

   o tutorial/documentation for scripting/extensions [Ronan Keegan]

   o python: rapper-gui and what-check (*Done?!)

   o high resolution auto-build

   o probe dots on selected residue range (Bob van Dreele)

14/08/08 
   o change orientation of refinement toolbar and make it dockable to 
     other sides of main window

* Done (but not automatically to change orientation)

14/08/08
    o make guile-gtk properly gtk2 complient (esp. text-view)

29/08/08
	o refinement of H at high resolution blows H around (fixed?)
	
	o move (& merge) symmetry related molecules (globularize?)

	o pictures in manual (how and where!?) Maybe more extensive (advanced)
	  tutorial!?

10/09/08
   o no bond colours if no element column in pdb file (e.g. CNS files)
     try to guess?! use coordconv?? new mmdb should fix

16/09/08
