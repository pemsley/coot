# 1.47 20060419 Remove the mmdb binaries

# 1.55 20060621 Shuffle around the test for using pre-release
# 1.56 20060626 Fixes from MATSUURA Takanori. Shuffle around the usage of

# 1.58 20060705 Fix wrong directory to build libtiff.
# 1.59 20060706 guile-config should run with an argument, otherise it

# 1.64 20060708 Add libungif test to installation, not system (imlib 
#               dependency).
# 1.65 20060710 Add removal of coot_wrap_guile.cc compilation when python

# 1.67 20060711 Try to fix up the Makefile for PNG.
# 1.68 20060723 Add in the updates to ltmain.sh, ltconfig and config.guess/sub

#               Readline version typo fixed.

# 1.70 20060728 pass CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to guile's configure
# 1.71 20060730 Add test for 64-bit Linux to update config.xxxs and libtool.
#               Installation readline built now, not system.
# 1.72 20060801 Use mmdb-1.0.8-ysbl-2, which installs includes in the include 
#               dir. This matches clipper cif_data_io.cpp which presumes that 
#               it is there. (And is a clean thing to do anyway).
# 1.73 20060801 Use the new version of libccp4c, with some of Ralf's patches
#               and includes that go into include/ccp4 dir.
# 1.74 20060801 Use CCP4_CXXFLAGS argument to clipper (it does the wrong thing
#               with --with-ccp4)
# 1.75 20060801 Use -pre-2 version of SSMlib, that has -Ixxx/include/mmdb to 
#               find mmdb include files.
# 1.76 20060808 test for libjpeg.$shared_lib_ext not libjpeg.so. LTE bug.
# 1.77 20060818 Force update of libtool and config files for libjpeg.  Extend 
#               the make install proceedure.  Lynn Ten Eyck reported problems 
#               here.
# 1.78 20060823 Add poll fix and getpwuid fix to glib build on Intel Mac.
# 1.79 20060827 Add fix for gtk-canvas from fink for Intel Mac.
# 1.80 20061002 Change freeglut test to test instaltion, not system.
# 1.81 20061012 The path used to find *-config files should be the same one
#               that new executables are added (it was $AUTOBUILD_INSTALLED)
#               and it should be $AUTOBUILD_INSTALLED-pre-release/bin) when
#               we are building a pre-release.
# 1.82 20061012 Change the destination tar file so that there are nightly 
#               and stable directories for the binary tar files on the web
#               server.
# 1.83 20061107 cd to the clipper dir when building clipper.  Pirate and 
#               bucca are not (attempted to be) built then.
# 1.84 20061107 Capture and report error status from make in GSL (intel mac 
#               build fails).
# 1.85 20061107 Use GSL version 1.8, which includes Charles Ballard's fix for
#               fp_regs.h
# 1.86 20061108 Add fink-based args for configure of gtk for Darwin
# 1.87 20061108 Fix ltmain.sh updating for Gtk (oops!).
# 1.88 20061122 Fix coot tar directory now that we have revision numbers in 
#               tar file name.
# 1.89 20061123 Fix/add test for ssmlib build (now depends on mmdb build) and 
#               libccp4c build (now depends on xxx/include/ccp4/cmtzlib.h).
# 1.90 20061128 Allow the user to specify if the dependencies should be checked
#               on the system or only in the autobuild installed directory.
#               Needs more checks to use this.  Currently only glib and gtk
#               tests.
# 1.91 20061211 Don't make install for guile-gtk if the make fails - or the 
#               dependency check for guile-gtk in coot's configure passes 
#               when it should fail (maybe).
# 1.92 20061212 Apply Charles Ballards libtool patch for Macs for imlib and 
#               guile-gtk.
# 1.93 20061212 Fiddle the env vars to compile gtk+ on Mac.
# 1.94 20070104 Non-pre-release build problems, BINARY_DEST_DIR
# 2.01 20070109 imlib tar gz should be downloaded from the correct directory 
#               (sigh).
# 2.02 20070117 Try to compile clipper with -fno-strict-aliasing
# 2.03 20070123 Tell us where the gtkglarea include file was found.
# 2.04 20070124 GCC 3.2 on RH8 machine cannot compile new clipper, so add a
#               patch if needed.
# 2.05 20070216 Put libtiff after libjpeg and give tiff's configure command
#               line args to find jpeg.
# 2.06 20070306 Put in the clipper<->ccp4 new dist patch.
# 2.07 20070319 Remove == comparisons - Lothar Esser.
# 2.08 20070424 --with-jpeg-lib-dir should be a lib dir!
# 2.09 20070501 Fix the setting of coot_version when no pre-release set.
# 2.10 20071002 Post install slim the binaries.  Add helper functions.
# 2.11 20071005 Add some debugging to make_tar.  It doesn't seem to work 
#               currently.
# 2.12 20071005 Fix post_install_slim call.
# 2.13 20071005 Fix slim_dir

# 2.18 20071105 Backpeddle to mmdb 1.08.  Baah.
# 2.19 20071108 Version 1.08-ysbl-3 of mmdb.
# 2.20 20071118 No longer make the full fat tar file.
# 2.21 20071120 Sourcefource no longer distributes libungif, now in 
#               ysbl software/extras
# 2.22 20071121 set the architecture for ubuntu systems.

# So, the idea is that you write a wrapper for this script (defining typically 
# AUTOBUILD_INSTALLED, AUTOBUILD_BUILD, LOGS and build_coot_prerelease) then
