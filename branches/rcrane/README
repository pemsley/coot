Coot
-------

Coot is a toolkit for Macromolecular Crystallography and
model-building.  Coot uses professional (and free) widgets (with the
gui builder glade), mmdb, clipper, and OpenGL, together with a new
approach to map contouring and importing/creation and other
modelling and building operations.


Redistribution
--------------

This software package (coot and its relatives) is Free Software.

This software is substantially dependent on on Free and Open Source
Software and software distributed under part (i) of the CCP4 Software
Licence and is therefore is distributed under the GNU General Public
Licence. 

Therefore, of course, you are able to use and redistribute this
software with *your* software (provided you also distribute this
source code).

You may find coot distributed with CCP4 Software.  Be aware that coot
is not covered under the CCP4 Software Licence, either part (i) or
part (ii).

This is Free Software - anyone referring to it as "Open Source" shall
be eaten by a gnu.

Prerequisites:
-------------

 To build this software from scratch, you will need:

 * a C++ compiler that knows about the STL.

 * gtk+ (1.2), 

 * gtkglarea, 
   http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/software/extras/gtkglarea-1.2.3.tar.gz

 * mmdb-1.12 (or later)

 * fftw-2.1.5, 

 * ccp4 libs,
   http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/software/extras/libccp4c-5.0.2-ysbl-2.tar.gz

 * clipper and its dependencies (its dependencies are ccp4 libs, mmdb, fftw)

 * OpenGL: (GL, glu, glut)

 And optionally (coot is better if you have these):
 
 * gsl-1.3 or later (http://www.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl)
   [This is quite important, you can't regularize or refine without this] 
 * gtk-canvas-0.1.1 (http://www.atai.org/gtk-canvas/)
   [for Ramachandran plots, sequence view]
 * guile-1.6.4 or later
   (http://www.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guile/) [scripting]
 * guile-gui-0.2.tar.gz (http://www.ossau.uklinux.net/guile/) [interactive scripting]
 * guile-www-1.1.5 or later (http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/software/extras/) 
   [OCA Server interface]
 * guile-gtk-0.40 or later (for gtk-1.2) 
   (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guile-gtk) [interactive scripting]
 * goosh-1.3 or later (http://arglist.com/guile/) 
   [external program (e.g. refmac, lsqman) interface] 
 * SSMlib (http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/software/extras/) 
   [superposition]

Building Automatically
----------------------

 I'd say that the easiest way to try to build coot is to use the
 auto-builder:

 GTK+-2 version (the standard version)
 http://coot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build-it-gtk2-simple

 GTK+-1 version (getting old and less well supported)
 http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/build-logs/build-it

 It checks for dependencies and builds them if needed.

 Pass the argument "python" if you want to have python built into the
 executable too (recommended).


 From a fresh ubuntu install, you also need to install:

 patch
 m4
 g++
 libxext-dev
 libxt-dev
 libc6-dev
 libglu1-mesa-dev 
 mesa-common-dev
 swig
 libgtk2.0-dev
 libgnomecanvas2-dev


Building by Hand
----------------

 Don't do this.  Try autobuilding first.  If that fails report to Paul
 (unless building on Windows, then report to Bernhard).  If you try to
 autobuild on Macintosh OS X: good luck.

 OK, if you ignore that advice.....

 First build and install mmdb and clipper.

  mmdb
  ----

 MMDB is CCP4's Macromolecular Coordinate Library written by Eugene
 Krissinel at the EBI.

 Note that official mmdb as distributed by Eugene does not install and
 does conform to normal "unix" standard notions of the behaviour of
 include and libraries. So either you will doing something by hand,
 and that is to link (or copy) mmdb.a to libmmdb.a (and that it is in
 the top directory of mmdb).

 Or the easier method is to pick up the version of mmdb that has been
 packaged with a GNU configure script from 
 http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/software/mmdb-1.21-ysbl.tar.gz 
 is the current version (at time of writing).

  clipper
  -------

Right now, building clipper is non-trivial.  clipper depends on mmdb,
so compile mmdb first.  

http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~cowtan/clipper/clipper-2.1-090522-ac.tar.gz

Configure clipper something like this:

./configure --prefix=$HOME/crystal --with-fftw=$HOME/crystal --with-mmdb=$HOME/crystal --with-ccp4=$HOME/crystal --enable-mmdb --enable-mtz --enable-cif --enable-mmdbold --enable-minimol --enable-phs

Clipper should give a summary like this (if it does not either clipper
or coot will not work)

        Configuration Summary
 ------------------------------
core:          yes
contrib:       yes
phs:           yes
mmdb:          yes
mmdbold:       yes
minimol:       yes
cif:           yes
mtz:           no
ccp4:          yes
cctbx:         no



 Other dependences:
 -----------------

 glib:

   If necessary, use: --with-glib-prefix=PREFIX

 gtk:

   If necessary, use: --with-gtk-prefix=PREFIX

 glut: 

   If necessary, use: --with-glut-prefix=PREFIX

 gtkglarea:

   If necessary, use --with-gtkgl-prefix=PREFIX

 guile

   use --with-guile

   If you use --with-guile you will need guile-config in your path

 python

   use --with-python


 Note that without either guile or python, coot is pretty crippled -
 and current the guile support is more developed - so use that for
 now, if you can.

 Building Coot
 -------------
To build coot, you will almost certainly need to specify the prefix
for clipper and mmdb.  Here is how I do it:

 ./configure --with-clipper-prefix=$HOME/crystal/clipper --with-mmdb-prefix=$HOME/crystal/mmdb112

Similarly you may also need to specify the path to gtkglarea libs using the
--with-gtkgl-prefix.

The following comments are copied (from the clipper and mmdb macros)
for you ease of reading:

 Example:

 So, here, for example, is the configure line used at the Daresbury
 development computer, dlpx1:

./configure --prefix=$HOME/gnu --with-gtk-prefix=/usr/local --with-gtkgl-prefix=$HOME/gnu --with-clipper-prefix=$HOME/cowtan --with-mmdb-prefix=$HOME/gnu --with-glib-prefix=/usr/local --with-glut-prefix=/usr/local

Here is how I configure using MacOS 10.2 (Darwin/fink):

./configure --prefix=$HOME/crystal --with-mmdb-prefix=$HOME/crystal --with-clipper-prefix=$HOME/crystal --with-glut-prefix=/sw --with-gl-prefix=/usr/X11R6 --with-guile

Redhat 7.2
 ./configure --prefix=$HOME/coot 
    --with-fftw-prefix=$HOME/coot
    --with-mmdb-prefix=$HOME/coot
    --with-gtkgl-prefix=$HOME/coot
    --with-clipper-prefix=$HOME/coot
    --with-gtkcanvas-prefix=$HOME/coot
    --with-guile

 SGI
 ---

  To use either the binary distribution or to use GTK_CANVAS (for
  Ramachandran plots), you will need to install the subsystem
  fw_imlib.sw.lib (imlib-1.9.9 from
  http://freeware.sgi.com/fw-6.2/index-by-alpha.html).  

  You will also need gcc and libungif.

  Note: Coot 0.1 moved to new style clipper and ccp4 libs and as a
  result I can no longer get clipper to compile on SGI with gcc/g++.
  Which means that Coot 0.1 won't work on SGI.  You can try to fix it
  - good luck.


Mac OS X
--------

The X11-dependent binary distribution for Mac OS X depends on having
some libraries installed by fink:

fink install gtk+ glib glib-shlibs guile16 guile16-libs guile16-shlibs guile16-dev glut glut-shlibs gtkglarea 
fink install imlib imlib-shlib

You also need Apple's X11 SDK.

You need to work around a fink guile wrinkle.  The configure script
needs to know that guile-1.6 is actually guile and guile-1.6-config is
actually guile-config.  To do this I created links to those from a
directory in my path.  To be explicit:

$ mkdir ~/build/bin
$ ln -s /sw/bin/guile-1.6 ~/build/bin/guile
$ ln -s /sw/bin/guile-1.6-config ~/build/bin/guile-config


If you want to be able to refine and regularize (and I suggest that
you do) you will need to install the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).  I
suggest that you install it in $HOME/coot/Darwin.  You will need to
add $HOME/coot/Darwin/bin to your path before you configure coot.
Also, it's a good idea to have gtk-canvas (installed in
$HOME/coot/Darwin) too.  Here's how I configure gtk-canvas:

$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/coot/Darwin --with-imlib-prefix=/sw

To compile, you will need to remove line 15 (the malloc line) from
gtk-canvas/gtk-canvas-load.c

If you use the binary tar, you will need to set the environment
variable DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Say you untared the binary distribution
into $HOME/coot, then you would need to add setup (tcsh) setup code of
the following form:

if ($?DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH) then
   setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $(DYLD_LIBRARY_DIR}:$HOME/coot/lib
else
   setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $HOME/coot/lib
endif

See also http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/coot/setup

The default mouse focusing with the Aqua window manager is a PITA when 
using coot. Try this:

$ defaults write com.apple.x11 wm_ffm true


Cygwin
------

To extend the available memory:
http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-maxmem.html


Ligand Dialog, aka LIDIA
------------------------

To get ligand builder dialog you will need to comile with a
sufficiently recent version of gtk (2.16 or later) and goocavanvas.


extension language wrapper
--------------------------

If you use Python without guile you will need to stop guile wrapper
code being compiled:

          $ cp src/blank.cc src/coot_wrap_guile.cc

before you do a make. [I'd like to sort out this problem in the
configure system, but I haven't managed it yet]

If you get:
coot_wrap_python.cc  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/coot_wrap_python.lo
coot_wrap_python.cc:26:20: Python.h: No such file or directory
coot_wrap_python.cc:247:20: Python.h: No such file or directory
make[2]: *** [coot_wrap_python.lo] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/paule/Projects/coot-0.4.36/src'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/paule/Projects/coot-0.4.36'

Solution: coot_wrap_python.cc needs to be updated now that python is
          no longer being used:

	  $ rm coot_wrap_python.cc
          $ make

../src/c-inner-main.c:76: undefined reference to `SWIG_init'

Solution coot_wrap_guile.cc needs to be updated now that guile is 
	 being used:

	 $ rm coot_wrap_guile.cc
	 $ make coot_wrap_guile.cc
	 $ make

Note that if you use the --with-python argument to coot's configure,
then you will need by hand to install (copy) the resulting src/coot.py
into $COOT_PREFIX/share/coot/python directory.


Usage:
-----

Environment Variables: 

  COOT_REF_STRUCTS:

    By default Coot looks in
    $prefix/share/coot/reference-structures, if not there then it
    checks the environment variable COOT_REF_STRUCTS (see below).

  COOT_STANDARD_RESIDUES:
   
    By defaults Coot looks in
    $prefix/share/coot/standard-residues.pdb, if not there then it
    checks the environment variable COOT_STANDARD_RESIDUES.

  COOT_SCHEME_DIR

    By defaults Coot looks in $prefix/share/coot/scheme for its scheme
    extension files, if not there then it checks in the directory
    pointed to by the environment variable COOT_SCHEME_DIR.
  
Reference Structures

  COOT_REF_STRUCTS is an environment variable that points to a
  directory of reference structures [these structures are used to
  generate a fragment library for the generation of the mainchain from
  Ca coordinates].  If you aren't building mainchain, you don't need
  them.  A set of high resolution (1.3A or better) is available from: 

  http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/software/coot-reference-structures.tar.gz


"External" Scheme Scripts
-------------------------

Ths error:

Loading scheme files from /usr/local/coot/share/coot/scheme
load "filter.scm"
load "coot-utils.scm"
load "coot-gui.scm"
(Error in proc: misc-error  args:  (#f ~A ~S (no code for module (gui
event-loop)) #f))
(Error in proc: unbound-variable  args:  (#f Unbound variable: ~S
(tips-gui) #f))

is fixed by installing the guile-gui package.

This error:

(...)

is fixed by installing the net-http package.


Scheme Usage
------------

Why write scripts in scheme when others are using python?

There are several answers to that, the most important (to me) is that
programming scheme is fun.  The scheme support for coot is more
advanced than the python support.  I feel the python support code
should be on at a similar level, I'm just not motivated to do it.
Patches accepted, of course :) Shouldn't take very long for someone
experienced in Python...


To Debug:
--------

CXXFLAGS=-g CFLAGS=-g ./configure 
make

or ./configure [options] CXXFLAGS=-g (for tcsh users)

Note that on RedHat Linux 8.0, you will need to compile with
CXXFLAGS=-O1 since the default optimization level (-O2) will crash the
compiler.

Idea Thanks
-----------

   I have a memory of a conversation with Mike Hartshorn - which
   planted the seed of the idea of writing a free model-building
   program in about 1991.  It took many years for this idea to bear
   fruit however. [Mike went on to write AstexView more rapidly].

   Many of the ideas in Coot are of course influenced by Alwyn Jones'
   O (and to a lesser extent Frodo).  I am grateful to him also
   because it in the late 80s that was sitting in front of a PS300
   running Frodo in York that I though "wow, this is what I want to
   do", without him and Frodo, I wouldn't be a crystallographer. 
   Thanks Alwyn.

   Many evening sessions with Adrian Lapthorn undoubtedly put some
   flesh on the bones of the ideas - certainly in those days we formed
   many opinions about The Right Way to do things.  Some of them are
   now present in Coot.

   Some credit for the way the interactive refinement works should go
   to Warren DeLano.  At a CCP4 Study Weekend (2003?) he presented
   "sculpt" mode in PyMol.  The audience (and I!) was really wowed.
   Until that point, I'd rejected the idea of such interactivity
   because it was not reproducable in the history (not easily,
   anyway).  But then I saw Warren's demo and I thought, "we've go to
   have that something like that too!"  It then took me a couple of
   days to bolt it into the existing real space refinement code.

   A little while ago now, I was demonstrated and impressed by PyMol's
   "view"s.  18 months later I added a view system to Coot.


Code Thanks...
---------

  particularly go to:

  Kevin Cowtan for many things, including clipper, explaining to me
  how it works :), writing the density (grid)->coordinate space
  transformation and general assistance when the maths got tricky,

  Eugene Krissinel for mmdb, 

  Eugene Krissinel and Kim Henrick for libssm,

  Raghavendra Chandrashekara for iso-surface code,

  Stuart McNicholas for MGTree code,

  Roland Dunbrack and co-worker for the rotamer library,

  Alexi Vagin for Refmac cif dictionaries,

  And Mr Behind-the-scenes-man (who allowed the whole thing to happen):  
  Prof. Keith Wilson,

  Finally, thanks to those who have emailed advice[1], the Coot
  testers[2] and particularly those who tried to compile the source
  code[3] and sent patches[4]: they suffered so that you don't have
  to.

  Thank you all - I have very much enjoyed doing Coot.
