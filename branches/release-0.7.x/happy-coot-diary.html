    <h1>The Happy Coot Developer Diary</h1>

<hr>
<p>Sat 25 Apr 11:43:21 2009 BST
</p>

<p>I've been trying to write papers and work on HAPPy in the previous
7 or 8 weeks.  HAPPy is making slow progress, but I have not managed
to get cphasematch to run (with some help from Kevin).  Raj and I
spotted a bug (sort of) in BP3 when HAPPy gives it extreme resolution
limits (well past the end of the anomalous data) BP3 it uses them.
Silly HAPPy for giving non-sensible limits, perhaps. </p>

<p>Anyway, back to Coot for a bit.  In rev 1965, I've fixed up a bug
that prevented mutation of DNA.</p> 

<p>Laptop upgraded to Jaunty yesterday (I've been running the beta for
2 months or so).  Nothing much changed.  The new notifications are a
bit ugly - being on a black background.</p>

<hr>
<p>Wed Feb 18 16:13:16 GMT 2009
</p>

<p>Other recent new stuff:

<ul>
<li>User-defined clicks
</ls>
<li>A new sequence view.
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>I've been working on symmetry and handling <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/pistart.html">PISA</a> output to represent interfaces and assemblies.  Still a lot to do here.  </p>

<p>Oh, and I changed the splash screen to 0.6-pre (Fulica americana).</p>


<hr>
<p>Wed Feb 18 15:57:47 GMT 2009</p>

<p>An update on last Thursdays bugs:</p>

<ul>
<li>The code now tests for the presence of menu tool bars to conditionally 
    compile the Rotation/Translation toolbar code.
</li>

<li>Stuart McNicholas and I had quite a bit of back and forth and he
    and I (mostly he)
    bashed the dihedral angle code into shape so that we can now
    rotate to the correct angle given an atom name spec quad.  Hooray.
    This was combined with the abiltity to search only a given region
    of the map.  This should advance ligand fitting in a known site.
    Next time I give a ligand-fitting talk I'll have to update my
    slides.  </li>

<li>It turns out (I discover after picking over the documentation)
    that the radio button group changes when you move from 2 items to
    1 item in a group (and also from 1 to 0 obviously).  I also
    discovered that you can use the group indirectly via a radio
    button already in the group.  So that's what I did, and thus
    deleted horrid ** pointer code.  Thus long-standing Display
    Manager bug is dead - hoorah.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Which still leaves the "terminal residue atoms as stars" bug.
</p>

<hr>
<p>Fri Feb  6 21:44:16 GMT 2009

<p>Failed to go to <a href="http://www.strubi.ox.ac.uk/">STRUBI</a>
today because of snow (buses canceled).</p>

<p>Worked on segids instead - and trying to fix this disconnect atoms
problem (no solution yet, but it doesn't seem to be about segids).


<hr>

<p>Thu Feb  5 00:23:37 GMT 2009</p>

<p>Frustrating day...</p>

<p>Tried to fix 3 bugs: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The non-compiling of the new Rot/Trans menu button on old
      GTK+s </li>
      <li>The settings of torsion angles for conformation generation in flexible ligands</li>
      <li>The crashing bug due to the scroll button in the display manager.</li>
    </ul>

<p>I got none of them fixed. And it goes without saying that I didn't
fix the "terminal residue as stars" bug previously mentioned...</p>

<p>Grumpy.</p>




<hr>

<p>Wed 04 Feb 14:12:06 2009 GMT

<p>I've changed the Rotate/Translate toolbar togglebutton to a menu
toolbutton - this allows you to change the mode of the
Rotate/Translate (choices of Residue Range, Chain and Molecule).
Annoyingly though RHEL 4 is quite backwards so its GTK+ does not have
menu toolbuttons.  So this is currently disabled for RHEL 4/CentOS
4/FC 3.  This will need a work-around.  It works nicely for systems
that have it though.


<hr>

<p>Mon 02 Feb 14:22:52 2009 GMT

<p>Add terminal residue, for some reason has been mis-behaving for a
while: when added, the new atoms show as disconnected "stars" (and also
the atoms were missing in the output pdb file).  I didn't know what
that was happening - but I knew that the previous release was OK.

<p>So I wrote a test and did a binary search through the SVN
repository.  I have not done this before for previous failures because
it involves a tremendous amount of autogen/configure/compile/install -
and never before have I thought it worth the time.  However, I have
just been given a 4-core brute (actually the RHEL 4 machine mentioned
below) and that made light work of the building.  Surprisingly quickly
I found the faulty commit (1727) - unfortuately that turns out to be a
big mash-up (a diff of 30,000 lines) of fixes/additions that I'd
written while on holiday recently - without network access. OK, strike
one for bazaar over subversion because using that I could have made
more fine-grained commits without network access.

<p>So, not out of the woods on this one yet.  However commit notes
describe changes related to segids - I wonder if that is the
problem...

<hr>
<p>Sun Feb  1 13:56:37 GMT 2009

<p>Back hacking on items in the todo list.  

<p>After an exchange on the CCP4bb and Coot mailing lists, I added
distance to protein to the GUI for the water search.

<hr>
<p>Sat 31 Jan 2009 06:57:04 GMT

<p>RHEL 4 64-bit binaries are now building (that's what I've been
doing since Boston).  libtool was out of date, so it was picking up
the wrong libGL at compile time for gtkglext and coot.  A new libtool
fixes that.  (For more elegance, I should investigate using ltmain.sh
instead of current fix.)

<p>Also, I installed Fedora 10 on what previously was the Centos 4
machine. I hope to virtual-box the CentOS 4 at some stage.

<p>I spoke to Martin Noble recently and he pointed me to the right
function to tweak to add partially-charged atoms to the electrostatic
calculation.  So now we can have something like:

<p>
<a href="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/ala-surface.png"><img src="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/ala-surface-small.png" alt="ala surface"></a>

<p>
(this is alanine of course).  

<p>The partial charges are read from the cif file for a given monomer
type - and that includes HET ligands - so if your cif-file-generating
program adds partial charges too you can do this to any monomer type.

<p>Oh, to be fair, I should add that I faked the transparency by
taking 2 images and using screen in the GIMP.

<hr>
<p>
Wed 28 Jan 2009 20:03:40 GMT

<p> Just back from the US - I was in the Boston Area - helping out (if
that is the right word) teaching with Piotr Sliz.  

<p>Man, Boston was cold.  Cold, cold, relentlessly cold.  When I got
back it was 7 degrees and I thought it was comfortably warm. 

<p>I did a brief talk to a few crystallographers at Harvard
Medical School (Steve Harrison was away though).

<p> Also, I made a presentation to the group(s) of Dagmar Ringe and
Greg Petsko in Brandeis (Chris Miller was there too).  That was an
enjoyable day - starting off with dim-sum and ending with chips and
beer (via way of a very pleasant pat on the back).

<p>I feel the need to try some French Caribbean rum at some stage.

<p>I was recommemded to go to Zaftig's for dinner - so I did (it being
a short walk to Coolidge Corner).  They provide complimentary toated
bagel slices as you sit - never seen such a thing before.  It occured
to me to wonder how they were made.  Surely not someone out the back
with a sharp knife - no, that would be a very tedious job and anyway,
there were simply too many to do.  So how did they make them then?
With something like an boiled egg-slicer?  But surely that would just
crush and tear a fresh bagel.  How about a ham slicer... well I
suppose that might do, but you'd have to watch your fingers - I can't
imagine that health and safety would approve of the method.  So I was
stumped.

<p>It turns out (of course, haha) that there is such a thing a bagel
slicer - I discovered it later when I googled for "toasted bagel
slices".

<p> OK, on to technical issues:

<p> "Sphere refinement" as it has been dubbed - seems to be a hit -
although I do have one (unreproducable) report of it crashing.  I have
since re-worked the residue selection part - hopefully that should
stabilize things.  (I suspect a bug in mmdb actually.  These days I
have a feel for how mmdb should work and in this part of code it is
behaving.. well, let's call it "unconventially".)

<p> I have added a <a
href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/coot/burn-up.png">graph</a>
to the development binary build page.  The graph plots scope and
progress through the todo list for the next release.  I knew that in
previous release cycles I'd added "must fix" items to the scope and I
wanted to trace how much doing so again would affect the release date
this time round.

<p>There is still a crashing bug in the delete molecule code - very
annoying.  It is a "2-star" imperative programmimg problem - difficult
to track.  It needs a boring day inside valgrind and I'm not rushing
to do it.

</p>

<p>
So much time has passed.  Nothing said!

<p>
Today is Intrepid Ibex day.  Installed on the laptop - the only computer
with some spare disk space.  I'm typing on it now.  Horrah! I like it!
The wireless works without any fuss for the first time, restoring 
from suspend only takes a few seconds now, rather than a minute or so.
Me likey.  Now to install a load of good stuff... first things to 
go on: tcsh, xemacs (this has been the way of my new computers for 
the last 20 years).  Then svn, patch. 

<p>
Then coot build dependencies...

<p>


<hr>
    <p>Fri Aug 15 16:01:12 BST 2008

    <p>I noticed that the refinement Chi squared values were not being
    added to the Accept/Reject dialog in the Gtk1 version.  So I have
    fixed that.

    <p>The restraints editor has been enabled for the Gtk 2.3 (Centos
    4.6) version.

    <p>I have at last moved over to using mmdb 1.11.  That involved a
    non-backwardly-compatible change, so all the Coot builds need to
    be built with mmdb 1.11 from now on.  The CISPEP test passes now -
    horrah! (i.e. Coot checks and corrects the cispep cards when
    writing out a PDB file now).

    <p>Bernhard has enabled loop fitting backwards and forward in the
    Python version and done something with the icons in the GTK+2
    version.  Now they look blurry instead of pixelated :-).  But more
    to the point, perhaps, GTK+2 Coot now fits on laptops screens
    (including the <a
    href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~cowtan/coot/coot-eee.png">Eee
    PC</a> according to Kevin).

    <p>The Ramachandran restraints have had lots of testing - and
    seeme to work just fine.  I need to find some test examples from
    the PDB where Ramachandran restraints on loops would fix up
    geometry - I need to get this sorted before going to the IUCr - I
    have 6 days to write the talk.

    <p>I went to see Arsenal vs Juventus and Hamburg vs Real Madrid at
    the Emirates the other weekend.  It was good (Arsenal failed to
    win however).

<hr>
    <p>Yay!  Ramachandran restraints work (or seem to for
    me). Revision 1318.

    <p>To turn them on, click Model/Fit/Refine -> Refinement Control
    -> Ramachandran Restraints -> On.

<p><A href="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/Ramachandran-restraints-in-action.png"><img src="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/Ramachandran-restraints-in-action-small.png" alt="Ramachandran angles refinement"></a>

    <p>Obviously a bit faked-up, you can see the "fixed" atoms are in
    the correct position, but this is showing you that there are
    problems with the geometry... (you didn't want to see a "6 greens"
    did you?)

<hr>
    <p>Yay!  The Centos machine builds Coot (revision 1298) - and the
    tests pass - the binary tar is on the web site now.  It doesn't
    compile completely out the box, I need to add the guile-gtk
    patches to the build script.

<hr>
    <p>Tue 29 Jul 22:11:42 2008 BST

    <p>Yep, the guile-gtk build failed.  I built it by hand and
    installed it.

    <p>But coot is still failing to build because it doesn't know not
    to use the AboutDialog widget - which does not exist exist in GTK
    version 2.4.13 - which is what exists on RHEL4 and CentOS4.6.

<hr>
    <p>Tue Jul 29 17:49:59 BST 2008

    <p>Dell machine was booted! The "noprobe" option was needed, so it
    didn't detect my mouse and I had to use text mode to install.  So,
    it boots up now, it detected USB keyboard and USB mouse on
    first-boot, but fails to run the screen at native resolution. DNS,
    NIS and NFS all working - which is more important.  I am doing a
    "yum update" as I type - 183 packages to be updated.

    <p>I think that I should be able to run the autobuilder on it
    tonight.  I expect guile-gtk to fail.

<hr>
    <p>Tue Jul 27 13:39:13 BST 2008

    <p>Hoorah!  I eventually got display lists working with side by
    side stereo.  Woop.  What a tangled web it was... the problem
    fundamentally, was the when compiling the display lists, we have
    to be in the correct GL context - and when there are side by side
    view, there are 2 gl contexts.  Generally speaking, I like to keep
    the interfaces as clean as possible, i.e. keep graphics and GL
    variables/functions/classes out out ostensibly lower-level classes
    (e.g. those to do with storing, representing and mapulating
    molecules and maps).  However, when making display lists (a
    molecule represenation issue, we need to know about the GL context
    state (a graphics issue) so the hierarchy was inverted in this
    case. Because of this, I had been doing a
    "draw_main_graphics_window()" then
    "draw_secondary_graphics_window()".  But when compiling the new
    lists (e.g. on switch to stereo or changing the contour level) I
    was not properly setting the context first.

    <p> And of course, additionally we need to take care that when the
    display lists are actually displayed, they use the correct GL
    context to draw them in. 

    <p>OK, done now.  Bill, your work-around can go - that should
    speed things up on a Mac.


<hr>
    <p>Sat 26 Jul 14:38:31 2008 BST

    <p>It seems that I am not the first to use the term "<a
    href="http://www.ljudmila.org/chrt/pp/cz/laos/imagepages/image95.htm">multichicken</a>".


<hr>
    <p>Sat 26 Jul 14:33:59 2008 BST

    <p>I forgot to mention that yesterday I took delivery of an (el
    cheapo) Dell Inspiron 530.  I booted Vista to find the MAC address
    so that it could be added to the network.  Very frustrating
    experience trying to use the GUI to do this.  I gave up and
    googled it.

    <p>Google said that I needed to type "getmac".

    <p>Hmmm...

    <p>Well, after that I tried to install CentOS 4.6 on it.  No go,
    though, it failed startup up the OS for the install (on the
    "select language" page).  I wonder if it was anything to do with
    APCI, and perhaps I should boot with the pci=noacpi flag.

    <p>I'll give it another go on Monday.

<hr>
    <p> Fri Jul 25 21:54:48 BST 2008

    <p>I've been in Holland this week - at Radboud University.  We
    made some progress on the What-If to Coot interface.  It looks
    quite cute, I think.  It currently seems to me that we have been a
    little gung-ho with the "Fix it" button - it is not clear what
    fraction of the problems can be usefully fixed with the "Fix it"
    function. We shall see - and of course it is possible that the
    "Fix it" function can get more sophisticated.

    <p>Also the paucity of the refinement residue selection protocol -
    particularly with reference to carbohydrates, was brought home to
    me by Thomas Lütteke.

    <p>So on the way home, I spent my time at Dusseldorf airport
    adding in a parser for chem_links and mod_lists from the Refmac
    library [1].  That job was substantially assisted by Ryanair
    cancelling the flight after one of the tugs rammed into the plane
    as we were about to board.  "Go away for 3 and a half hours", they
    said.

    <p>It goes without saying that they didn't play their jaunty
    buggle jingle when we eventually landed...

    <p>Didn't get home until about 3am.  Baah.

    <p>[1] (OK, so I did watch a bit of X-Files too.)


<hr>
    <p>Wed 16 Jul 16:10:15 2008 BST

    <p>Much head-scratching over torsion restraints failing.

    <p>I eventually tracked it down to failing when there was a PRO in
    the residue selection.  Why should PRO be a problem? (I thought)
    Let's look at the torsion definition in PRO.cif:

<pre>
 PRO      chi1     N      CA     CB     CG       -25.000   15.000   3
 PRO      chi2     CA     CB     CG     CD        35.000   15.000   3
 PRO      chi3     CB     CG     CD     N        -30.000   15.000   3
</pre>

    <p>Ah, there we go, it's a circular sytem of chi angles.  Bleugh.
    It causes my minimizer to collapse in a heap.

    <p>OK, turn off torsion refinement for prolines then.  (Maybe I
    should have included just chi1 - but I didn't). So here are the
    numerical and analytical torsion gradients for a residue selection
    including a PRO:

<p><A href="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/Screenshot-PRO-torsions-improved.png"><img src="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/Screenshot-PRO-torsions-improved-small.png" alt="residue selection with PRO torsion gradients"></a>

    <p>Yay!  Clean.


<hr>
    <p>Tue 15 Jul 22:52:54 2008 BST

    <p>One step forward, 2 steps back.  Some progress was made with
    the Ramachandran restraints. However, I still can't make the
    numerical and analytical gradients match - despite hours of
    staring at the code and sketching out what is going on in
    pencil...  Baah.  

    <p> It seems that the torsions might be broken - the numerical vs
    analytical gradients have the measles (of course it should be an
    "uninfected" straight line otherwise the refinement goes unstable
    - "line search abandoned", that sort of thing). (And of course
    torsions restraints are a pre-requisite to Ramachandran
    restraints.)

<p><A href="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/Screenshot-torsion-gradients.png"><img src="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/Screenshot-torsion-gradients-small.png" alt="torsion gradients"></a>

    <p>Oh well, another bash at it tomorrow...


<hr>
    <p>Fri Jul 11 00:46:02 BST 2008

    <p>Well it turns out that I did add some test code, not as much as
    I would have liked, but I spent time fixing some GUI problems.
    More Rama testing tomorrow.

<hr>
    <p>Thu 10 Jul 11:10:39 2008 BST

    <p>Yesterday, I was testing conformation generation for flexible
    ligands.  That looked OK. I think when there are bonding problems
    from using this algorithm, that occurs because Coot is sampling
    angles from torsions in a ribose or some other ring system.  It
    seems to me that these torsion angles should not be allowed to be
    sampled.  But that is not something that Coot should make a
    decision about.  Not today, anyway.

    <p>Today is for putting in place test code for phi/psi angles and
    ramachandran plot probabilities... i.e. I am beginning to tackle
    the addition of Ramachandran restraints in real space refinement.

    <p>"At long last" - you might say.

    <p>(Hmmm).


<hr>
    <p>Mon 07 Jul 16:28:37 2008 BST 

    <p>OK, rotamer probabilities for residues with alt confs can be
    put to bed.  Horrah.

<p><A href="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/alt-confed-rotamers.png"><img src="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/alt-confed-rotamers-small.png" alt="image or rotamer plot comparison - with fixed blocks for residues with alt confs"></a>

    <p>The block for 72 B has gone away to almost nothing.


<hr>
    <p>Mon 07 Jul 03:02:15 2008 BST
</p>
    <p>
      Today, I will try a 4th attempt and returning a variable number
      of probabilities for each residue. The current rotamer/chi angle
      code is a mess - the worse part of coot source, this is partly
      due to Dunbrack rotamer legacy.  I had wanted to keep Dunbrack
      rotamers as a compile time option.  I may ditch that idea to
      keep new code cleaner.
    <p>
<hr>
<P>
Thu Jul  3 17:30:32 BST 2008
</P>
<P>
  Rotamer probabilities are not as plain sailing as I'd though.  If
  you look carefully at the image posted yesterday, you will
  notice that we now get a "missing atoms" block for residue 72 B in
  the new version, whereas we has nothing of note there previously.
  This is caused by the extra atoms due to alt confs making the
  rotamer unrecognisable.  I suppose that I need to extend the
  analysis to provide a variable number of probabilities for each
  residue.
 </P>

<hr>
    <p>Wed 02 Jul 14:07:57 2008 BST

    <p>Here's a bit of fun: multi-chicken.  This makes multiple
    representations of the map in varying colours.  You need a decent
    graphics card to work with it though.

<p><A href="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/multi-chicken.png"><img src="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/multi-chicken-small.png" alt="image or rotamer plot comparison"></a>

<hr>
    <p>
      Wed Jul  2 07:08:46 BST 2008
    <p>
      OK, so the reading of the probability tables at start-up is just
      too slow to be tolerated - I will change it so that it is read
      when needed - which will slow down the first rotamer probability
      plot (instead).
    <p>
      Here's the old and new rotamer probability plot compared. 
<p><A href="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/rotamer-probabilites-both.png"><img src="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/rotamer-probabilites-both-small.png" alt="image or rotamer plot comparison"></a>
      <p> Much better signal to noise now.  All the large blocks in the new
      plot are genuine problems - with the exception of a ARG rotamer
      at 0.17% probability (which probably is not problematic, I
      think). Implemented in revision 1193.

<hr>
    <p>Mon 30 Jun 14:45:56 2008 BST
    </p>

    <p>Back from France.  Back hacking on rotamer probabilities. I've
    added the rotamer tables to the distribution now.  It bulks up the
    tar file and slows down the startup of coot.</p>

    <p>We have enabled running "Refmac with no labels" in the scheme
    version (the python version has had it for a while).  Cool.  Now
    if only ccp4i would listen to Coot, people might actually use
    this Refmac interface...</p>

<hr>
<p>Tue Jun 24 12:52:18 BST 2008

<p>ARP/wARP loopy day today.  Which means an XML day, largely.  I
decided that using the <a
href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/xml.html">SXML</a> interface was the
way to go.  And the consequence of that is that we need another
dependency, guile-lib.  It's good for the soul.  I have added this
to the autobuilders.

<hr>
<p>Tue 24 Jun 00:46:23 2008 BST

<p>As you may know - over the past year or so, there is a timer in
Coot, which after a certain amount of time lets you know that a new
version of Coot is available.  Coot does not "phone home" to find this
information, I just guess, at release time, when there will be a new
version out at a particular future date - and I give myself several
months margin.  However, with 0.5 slipping, that date is fast
approaching (end of July, if you look it up) for the 0.4 series.  So
I'd like a new release out by then or else Coot will say "Get a new
Coot" - but there will be no new Coot available.  And that will be
bad.

<p>I've been attacking the TODO list for 0.5 these past 10 days or so.
Currently it's at 11 items.  Several of those depend on MMDB PDB 3.0
support and it seems (fingers crossed) that that may actually get
released in the foreseeable future.

<p>Then there are the two big ones, Ramachandran restraints and
correction of the rotamer probabilities.

<p>I now have 3 probability distributions for the Ramachandran
restraints.  I'd like to make all 3 available, so the user can choose.
The Otwinowski parameterization is the most elegant (and least
straightforward). Without testing them yet, my feeling is that there
will not be much to choose between them. We'll see.

<p>The rotamer probability distributions are from the Richardsons - I
brought them back with me recently.  I am not sure how to distribute
them - they are 45Mb or so.  My estimate is they can be properly
integrated into Coot in less than 20 hours work.

<p>Going to France for a wedding next week, which will remove any
slack that I might have had in the release schedule...  Hey ho.

<p>Recent additions: Map Transformation by LSQing models, align&mutate
function cleaned up (so that, amongst other things, Add Terminal
Residue knows what residue type it should be), stereo map drawing
issues addressed, updates for GCC 4.3, MSE rotamers in Alt Confs, NCS
chain skipping with hetero-dimers fixed. (Mac distro has taken a
back-seat).

<p>Sat 14 Jun 00:57:14 2008 BST

<p>First "restful" week in ages.  Since the start of this year I have
been to Reading (CCP4 Study Weekend) Abingdon (CCP4 developers
meeting), Boston (Harvard Medical School, SBGrid Workshop), London
(CCP4 Working Group II), EBI, Cambridge (Validation Workshop), Oulu,
Finland (CCP4 Workshop) India (Bangalore (CCP4 Workshop)), Chennai
(Internation Symposium on the Advances in Structural Biology), Beijing
(CSHL Course-China), Knoxville (ACA), Duke (chez Richardsons).  And
that has not left me much time to work (or write it up here).  And
foolish me, (as I've said before) I forgot to account for these
meetings when I scheduled the release of 0.5.  So now 0.5 is way
overdue.  And I become anxious about hitting the deadline for
1.0. Hmm.  Well maybe I'll just have to let it whoosh by...

<p>I always like the ACA, but this year it was particularly quiet, I
thought.  Not much action at the CCP4 stand.  A few people came over
and said hello, which I appreciated.

<p>I don't think putting trout in an underground lake is a good idea
- not for the fish anyway.

<hr>
<p>Fri 13 Jun 15:20:50 2008 BST

<p>Back from the ACA. I came back from Knoxville with Jane and David
Richardson and spent the next day in their lab. Making plans.
Mini-RSR as a python extension - that would be useful.  Not sure how
to handle clipper objects (e.g. an Xmap) and coot objects
(e.g. restraints) from python though.  I'll look at it after 0.5 is
out.

<p>Also it seemed an easy addition to include a pucker checker into
Coot after the method described in their Molprobity paper (Davis et
al. (2007) Molprobity: all atom contacts and structure validation for
proteins and nucleic acids, Nucleic Acids Research 35, W375-W383).

<p>It was indeed pretty easy and the result is called "Pukka Puckers?" 
and now lives in the Validation menu.

<p>After talking to Herb Klei at the ACA I added cheap "Active Site
Hilighting".  This lives in the Extensions for now.  Here is an example:

<p><A href="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/Active-Site-hilighting.png"><img src="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/Active-Site-hilighting-small.png" alt="image of Active Site Highlighting"></a>

<p>

<p>The Mac build (from May) worked fine. I have not yet gotten around
to making a stand-alone binary tar from it though.

<p>After coming back from the SBGrid Workshop, I am interested in ray
tracing and how to get that in to Coot.  There is no easy way to add a
ray tracer - which is slightly annoying, there are lots of ray tracers
but none of them fit the bill.  Yafray might be the best of the bunch.
Its documentation is terrible though.  And it seems to be dead or in
stasis for a couple of years.  Hmm...


<hr>
<p>Tue May 20 20:18:04 BST 2008

<p>Fixed up the flying hydrogens problem today (apparent after
undoing).

<p>Things are moving forward on the Mac front... I am doing a fink
install coot as we speak.  I intend to use that in the daily builds
and put the Mac snapshot pre-released on the web site too.

<p>YSBL web site has been down today causing some disgruntlement
amongst users who want their (daily? :) dose of fresh Coot.

<p>Hardy comes with a GCC 4.3 for testing.  4.3 is not happy with way
mmdb is used in Coot.  I am corresponding with Eugene Krissinel about
how to resolve this.


<hr>
<p> Sat May 17 11:40:47 BST 2008 

<p>Back from Boston/Harvard and Beijing.  Lots of mails to deal with.

<p>As a result of this trip, I am much more committed to getting things
working on the Mac.  I think I will make a stand-alone "coot-only" 
fink-based installation.

<p>Both Harvard Medical School and the Institute of Biophysics
(Beijing) tutorials were completely Mac-based.  In the Coot tutorials
at the IBP, the X11 on the Macs crashed about 30 times in a 3hr
session. Not good.  Bad, in fact.

<p>Something interesting (for me) became apparent.  Several of the
students on the course had used Coot before, and they fired up Coot
and loaded the tutorial files and started doing the modifications
faster than I'd seen before at other tutorials.  However, as soon as
we started talking about features that were not completely
discoverable (e.g. single atom drag, over-dragging, auto-zone) the
pace slowed down dramatically.  Hit a brick wall in fact.  These
features are extensively described in the documentation, but these
Coot users just didn't know about them.  So I need to think about
making them more obvious.  If possible.

<p>Having tried a recent Coot on the Mac though, I did discover a
couple of problems with display lists - and fixing one of those caused
a resolution of the testing problems on the Ubuntu build host.  So
that is cleaned up at last, hoorah.

<p>I installed Hardy this morning, I am typing this on Hardy now (in
vi - as I am waiting for xemacs to download and install).  Also,
installing Coot dependencies to see if compiz is compatible with Coot
yet....

<p>Baah, no.  It isn't.  Lot's of flashing/blanking of the windows and
misdrawing of the z-order.  OK, desktop effects off :-(.

<p>But at least I can use xemacs now.

<p>Incidentally, the ability to display the key bindings in a GUI was
a hit, it seems.

<p>Coot compiles out of the box on Hardy (GCC 4.2.3).

<hr>
<p>Sat May  3 11:39:54 EDT 2008

<p>The static key bindings are now displayed in a dialog.

<hr>
<p>Sat May  3 11:39:44 EDT 2008

<p>Now that the web page build analyser is in place (how did I live
without it?), it has become necessary for me to more frequently be
able to build Coot on the old/standard Coot machine (GTK1 with Python
on Red Hat 8).  I've been wanting to be able to do the build "from a
one-liner" for a long time, the "build status " web page was the thing 
that broke the camel's back (as it were) and I decided to put some 
effort into making it happen.

<p>Previously, I'd been logging in through the firewall to the build
host and running the command there - slightly tedious.  Now, I knew that 
expect can handle that sort of thing for us.  However, I was not going to program
in tcl - no way, so the Don Libes version was not an option.  What's
left? Guile.  Let's give that a go.

<p>So, I tried for about an hour or so - probably more - but was not
making headway.  The documentation was spare and only a few
examples. There seemed to be some problem with pseudo terminals over
ssh.

<p>OK, what else? Python?  Python has expect?

<p>(google google).. oh yes, it does.  Pexpect, it's called.

<p>Within 20 minutes of downloading it, I'd got it doing just what I
wanted.  Pexpect was trivial to install, fully featured, well
documented and easy to use.  The result was just a few lines of code,
in fact.  I grudgingly admit that python/pexpect was a much better
solution than using guile.

<hr>
<p>Thu May  1 01:18:05 BST 2008

<p>Builds back to normal... (although the build hosts are dropping
like flies (now the RFC6 machine has gone west)).

<p> The key bindings - which are dynamic, of course - can now be
displayed in a gui dialog that is activated from the Extensions menu.
I need to add the static key bindings there too, I think.

<p>Bernhard and I are experimenting with/implementing a system to call
python functions from scheme and vice versa.  And have the return
values converted in the process.  The new side chain assignment
interface that he wrote (in Python) will be used that way.

<p>I write this from a bed and breakfast bed near Harvard Yard - I
flew to Boston today. Easy trip.  Now, I discover, immigration wants a
to scan all fingers for finger prints...

<hr>
<p>Sun 27 Apr 11:05:44 2008 BST

<p>Oh, ha!  This is what I saw on checking the builds this morning:

<p> <a
href="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/Build-Summary-bad.png"><img
src="http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/emsley/pictures/various/Build-Summary-bad-small.png"></a>.

<p>Yikes! a screen full of failure.  I'd forgotten to update the test
for key-bindings (I'd changed the function so that the bindings take a
name string, but not also updated the test). Fixed now.

<p>Sad to say I won't have much time to examine non-trivial items on
the TODO list for 0.5 until after the ACA.  I guess I'll have to push
back the release again.  I hadn't sufficiently accounted for
meetings/courses and other things.  Baah.


<hr>
<p>Sat Apr 26 05:01:19 BST 2008

<p>Leaving for home in a couple of hours.  Looking forward to getting
back and trying Hardy (I'll have to wipe out an Edgy to do it).


<hr>

<p>Fri Apr 25 22:12:16 BST 2008

<p> Just finished Finnish Bioxhit course (Oulu).  Was good (for me at
least).  I utterly broke the key bindings in the last presentation (in
an attempt to make a GUI that displayed them).  Bah.  With just one
minute more preparation, I could have fixed it.  Anyway, it works now
(of course) and has been added to the Extensions menu.

<p>I have some photos somewhere.

<p>The Fedora Core 6 binaries are no longer being built - that's
because the FC6 machine in York was upgraded to a F8 machine :-(.

<p>Also, possibly found why the Coot binaries became very unportable
when python was introduced.  Needs testing.

<p>After about 2 years of being broken, I fixed up the script that
converts svn to source code tar file while I was here (a stupid typo
in setting $PATH).

<p>However, the release (0.5) critical features list has not been
reduced in about a month.  Badness, I've had to push back the release
date a month.

<p>I note that Bernhard has done something interesting with the icons
in the python extensions and I hope/think that this makes them
anti-aliased.  It would be nice to get the currently ugly icons fixed
up at last.

<hr>
<p>Fri Mar  7 17:57:17 GMT 2008

<p>I gave up trying to compile Gtk2+ from scratch.  Just too hard.
Now the build system of Coot requires Gtk+ 2.4 or better.  That seems
to be doing the trick.  I am using the "simple" build script to build
Fedora Gtk2 binaries in York.

<p>The molecule array to molecule vector transformation was a success.
Thank goodness for the test suite, which tripped over most of the bugs
(not all, it must be said).

<p>Recently, I have added Scheme and python interfaces to the getting and
setting of the monomer restraint information.  It was easier than I
thought it was going to be, (I expected it to be tricky and lengthy,
and in fact is was just lengthy).  Now this needs a GUI, which again I
suspect will be both lengthy and tricky to implement (taking more than
a day).

<p>"Additional Representations" are in the works too - this has taken a
bit of internal surgery - as I suspected, but it is OK elegance-wise.
I've currently got it working from the scripting layer.  Now I need to
create a gui so that the user can define a new representation by
filling in entry boxes.  Also, a gui to remove (undisplay)
representations.

<p>Also, the key binding mechanism has changed today.  Now there is an
external function add-key-binding which adds [a key number (currently)
and a thunk] to an association list (*key-bindings*).  Now
graphics-general-key-press-hook tests the key vs the association
list.  Much cleaner.

<p>Yesterday, I added a function "Save dialog positions" which saves a
state file and extracts from that the dialog positions and adds them
to the .coot file in $HOME.

<p>I learnt the other day of a Chemical Components dictionary
distributed by the PDB.  I tried to get Coot to read it (it has more
than 5000 entries and over 1 million lines) but it failed.  That was
due to a line length limitation in mmdb's mmCIF parser it turned out.
Hopefully that will be resolved soon.  When it is, we will be able to
instantaneously (more or less) beam in any of those Components.
That'll be cool...

<p>We have a new splash screen for 0.5-pre.  From an actual photograph.

<hr>
<p>Thu 31 Jan 14:15:27 2008 GMT

<p>Back to "blogging", now that new system arrangements are somewhat
better.

<p>Two major projects going on at the same time.  One is to move the
molecules array to a vector.  Which means that there is no limit now
to the number of molecules that you can display.  Previously there was
a fixed limit of 50, and Coot would try to dynamically resize if you
went over that limit.  That was inelegant.  I've been meaning to do
this change for years.

<p>The other project is to get "Gtk+2 + python" binaries to autobuild.
What an utter pain this is turning out to be.  The package stack to
get Gtk+2 to build is about 10 packages (and counting) of twisty
inter-dependencies.  The dependencies for PyGtk are only slightly
better.  And I'm trying to get this to build from one script across
all platforms. Very tedious.
