I may have sent you this to this post. It's because I am bored of typing out
basically the same message every week for the last several years.

What I want to know is:

- Which version of Coot are you using?
- Which OS are you using?
- Where did you get your Coot? (I don't support CCP4 binaries)
- What did you click/press?
- What did you see?
- What does it say in the terminal?
- What did you expect to see?

(A screen-shot or two is often helpful.)

I ask these things because Coot behaves differently on different systems - and
(rather obviously) I need to know the system before I can begin to debug the
problem. Additionally, although I may not be able to help with your problem this time,
it can be a useful data-point for diagnosing someone else's problem in the future.

Perhaps most importantly of all, you should ask yourself "have a
reported this in a way that make it easy (or at least possible) for
Paul to reproduce?"

Additional information:

- I don't know much about WinCoot and never use it. If you have
troubles with that, try the latest release/pre-release:
