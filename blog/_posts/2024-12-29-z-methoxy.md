`z-methoxy` is intended to replace `cd` for tcsh.
After some "training" it cuts down on the number of keystokes
you need to type to move around your filesystem.

Many years ago I heard about autojump, but I could never get it
to work in tcsh. More recently I heard about `zoxide` and decided
to try that. It turned out that I couldn't get `zoxide` to work either.

After watching [Dreams of Autonomy's zoxide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aghxkpyRVDY&pp=ygUGem94aWRl)
I was convinced enough to write a version myself that worked with tcsh.

Then I rewote it in Rust - and this is the result:

There is also a command `cdi` that uses `fzf` for interactive fuzzy finding/search.
