-----

  Release 1.1.12

  o TERMINAL OUTPUT: Coot's startup, in particular the graphics and Python, have
    lately been problematic (i.e. flaky/broken).  Different operating systems,
    different drivers, and different versions of Python add to the complexity.
    We have spent quite some time refactoring this - and especially so in the
    last few weeks. To help understand what is going wrong on startup I have
    increased the amount of diagnostic information on the terminal - so it's a
    bit ugly at the moment.
    When issues have been resolved and the startup is stable, I will reduce/remove
    the diagnostics.

    add_terminal_residue_directly()
    copy_molecule()
    flood()

----

  Release 1.1

18 months after the release of Coot 1 it's time for Coot 1.1

Coot 1.1 is a major change beyond Coot 1. It has required a lot of
writing and rewriting and has been the focus of my work since last year.

Technically (but briefly) we have rewritten the GUI again so that it is
now is based on GTK4 (Coot 1 used GTK3). This has meant a lot of rewiring
under the hood so that things behave similar to before [1].

Many things, that is. Not all things. There are a few important
differences - they are for the better (although you may not initially
think so).

   o View rotation is on right-mouse (except on Mac).
   o Functions are activate in "Select First" mode (that means bringing
     the atom/residue/chain of interest to the centre of the screen)
     and then choosing the function. This is more consistent with the
     use of hot-key/key-bindings.
   o Widget "focus" is different in GTK4 - I don't yet fully understand it
     at the moment, so, in case Coot "forgets" to revert focus back to the
     main graphics widget, there is a "Grab Focus" button in the horizontal
     toolbar.
   o Many of the menu items have been moved around. Now they are far more
     likely to be where they will finally end up.
   o "Modelling" (as we like to label it in the UK) has its own top-level.
   o "Modules" is now also on the top-level instead of being in the
     "Calculate" menu.

Not everything made it:

   o "Symmetry by Molecule" has been removed (for the moment).
   o RCrane and the glycan builder have yet to be brought back to working
     order.
   o FLEV, QED breakouts and Chemical Feature Clusters are still missing.
   o The PISA interface is missing.

I am grateful for the contributions from Jakub Smulski for help with
this over the last year and to Global Phasing for the funding. Martin
Noble has written the ribbon and surface representation code.

At the moment, the terminal output is a bit verbose with debugging output.
That will be reduced or removed in due course.

Although I've not tried it, I hope/expect that this Coot will run very
sweetly on a M2 Pro MacBook Pro... "M2 good, M3 better" - I suppose?

Binaries:

   Binaries have always been issue with Coot. The problem is that a
   project of the scale of Coot needs (at least) 3 people [2],
     o one for the scientific developments/new algorithms and publications
     o one for the development of the GUI (and graphics in the case of Coot)
     o one for the deployment of binaries - it takes time to produce binaries
       for numerous versions of numerous operating systems and the many
       changing/improving dependencies (to me this feels like a constantly
       changing, never complete jigsaw puzzle)
   And, although I recognise its importance, I just keep dropping the ball
   for the third one (is has little intrinsic pleasure for me and is
   completely invisible career-wise).

   Coot on "Linux":

      There is a build-script, build-coot-3-3 that works for me, soup to
      nuts on a modern Ubuntu system. Not so much on Fedora though. I will
      try to help if you try this method and things go wrong. Python and
      its add-ons are exquisitely tricky to build and is not well documented,
      however [3].

      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pemsley/coot/main/build-it-3-3

   Coot on macOS:

      Some Mac users might like to consider using Homebrew. At some stage
      I hope that
         $ brew install coot
      will (just) work. But that will involve input from by Yoshitaka
      Moriwaki who is looking after Coot in Homebrew (that might take a
      month or two).  Right now, Mac-using homebrew-using Coot
      enthusiasts can follow issue 33 on github:
      https://github.com/pemsley/coot/issues/33

   Coot on "Windows":

      Bernhard Lohkamp is the font of all wisdom when it comes to
      WinCoot. He will let us know his schedule. (Within a month though,
      that is my understanding.)

   via CCP4:

      In the coming weeks CCP4 will review Coot 1.1 and decide if it is
      acceptable to be added to the suite. If approved, that is the path
      of least effort for me and many users.

What about 0.9.x?

   I will maintain the back-end/libraries until April 2024, then I will
   reassess. It's just too much trouble to change the GUI though.

Future:

   With such a massive change set [4], there are bound to be bugs, so I imagine
   a flurry of patch releases in the forthcoming weeks.

   With this bad boy [5] out the door and with Lucrezia Catapano coming
   back on-line I can spend more time on Moorhen [6] and the Blender
   interface - hooray!

   If you've got this far and can get this Coot to run, I have added an Easter
   Egg for today (I'll tell you what it is: coot.halloween()).

[1] To give you an idea of the scope of this work (and the speed at which the
    interface for Coot was implemented) look how long it takes to rewrite a
    GUI:
    https://fosspost.org/gtk-4-0-released/
[2] According to a Basic COCOMO model I found, a project of this size is the
    output that can be expected from a team of 300 working for 56 months (make
    of that what you will)

    Coot 1

18 years after the release of Coot 0 it's time that I actually released Coot 1.

Coot 1 is a major change beyond Coot 0. It has required a lot of writing and rewriting [1]
and has been the preponderance of my work since 2017. I have had to learn how to program
graphics from scratch using the new style. Much of the GUI internals has been
rewritten [2].

My experience with 0.9 was that I sat on it, bug-fixing for a long time, releasing it
too late. I don't want to repeat that mistake. So here we are, there's a lot of good new
stuff in Coot 1, but it's not as slick as it might be (or will become).

  o Update graphics to use OpenGL 3.3
  o Update Python to use version 3.9
  o Update GTK+ to use version 3

While many of the features that were available in 0.9.x have been reworked or
reimplemented, there are some gaps. Dropped features include Cross-hairs, Stereo, Pisa
interface, built-in key-bindings, NCS Ghosts, Edit Phi/Psi, antialiasing, Kleywegt
plots, the clipping dialog, Chemical Feature Clustering, Dynamically-Transformed/NCS
Maps, LSQ plane distances, dynamic distances, CABLAM-markup, the test suite,
user-defined colour schemes, anisotropic atoms, CURLEW, Scheme GUI scripting,
Skeletonization and Baton-Building.

"So, is there anything that _does_ work?" - you might ask...

The GUI has been updated, I have tried to cut down on the number of dialogs, the Real
Space Refinement in particular has seen quite a lot of work. The GUI now uses dark mode
if the theme is installed [3]. Several menu items have been relocated. More menus are now
alphabetically ordered [4].

The graphics is, by default, now based on triangles instead of lines which affords a
more pleasing representation (density maps can be represented using both modes) and one
can have a more expeditious if not pleasant experience with a fast graphics card and a
big screen. The various graphics effects and filters can be tailored to some extent by
changing the configuration using the GUI or by editing/replacing the shaders.
Full-screen mode is now an option [5].

Overall, the GUI has only had light testing. At the moment, it's probably best to
avoid closing dialogs using the window manager. The "OK" button now appears after the
"Cancel" button in dialogs.

Python scripting now has uses a history from previous sessions and the functions need
to be used with namespaces/modules (e.g. "coot", or "coot_utils"). Coot (or coot) is
now a module that can be imported into python.

This build compiles with the RDKit and optionally MoleculestoTriangles from Martin Noble.

The map and the model can now be exported to glTF files (for use in Blender and other
3D modelling software).

The build script for Coot 1, called build-it-3-3 can be found in the "Build from Scratch"
menu on the web page (you will need to have already installed cmake and Gtk+). The catch
though is that (at least in my hands) Python and friends are frustratingly difficult to
install, so it's possible/likely that the build script won't work. Likewise,
the script doesn't work for Mac OS either. But it is currently the best method to get
binaries so I will support it if you try it [6]. (Homebrew might be another method.)

Bernhard Lohkamp has been working on the WinCoot version - I will defer WinCoot
questions to him.

Mac Coot is now native (no X11/XQuartz needed). I would be interested to see how a
natively-compiled [7] version works on a M1 Max processor [8,9].

Judging from previous experience, a few rapid iterations of bug-fix releases will be
needed. After this, the version numbers will become sane - it's my plan to release a new
major version every year or so.

[1] new as in OpenGL 3.3 or later - using shaders - I don't mean Vulkan (that's for the
    future)
[2] the patch from the 0.9.x version is 285k lines
[3] I recommend it
[4] rather than chronologically
[5] double-tap Esc key (the first time) to revert to standard display
[6] I have be working with CCP4 collaborators to use their system to build Coot binaries.
    Hopefully the binaries will be available stand-alone, as well as integrated into
    the CCP4 Suite via that method
[7] so that's a different meaning of "native"
[8] the little testing I have done on a recent intel MacBook Pro shows unimpressive
    performance (Iris graphics, retina display)
[9] Thanks to my Mac-using colleagues for their feedback.

     introduced. If the directory pointed to by COOT_SCHEME_EXTRA_DIR
     exists, then Coot will read all the .scm files in that directory

   o BUG-FIX: METs can no longer form disulphide bridges [Wendy Offen].

   o CHANGE: Temperature factor variance validation now works for SHELXL
     molecules [GMS, JED]

   o CHANGE: Map transformation now works differently.  Instead of
     providing the point from which the map is copied, one passes the
     target position to which the map should be copied (and the position
     from which the map is copied is calculated from this target
     position by the inverse transformation of the operator which moves
     the coordinates).  This seems more natural to me.

     large regions of the plot [GMS]
  
   o CHANGE: Extensions menu tided.

   o CHANGE: multi-read-pdb no longer recentres.  Speeds things up [JED].

   o KNOWN PROBLEM: Rotamer analysis gives too many bad/unusual rotamers.

   mode.

 o Symmetry display re-worked.  After superposition, turn off the
   molecule symmetry [EP].  This may affect a few .coot and saved
   sesion files.  The set-show-symmetry function is
   no-longer available, use set-show-symmetry-master instead.

 o Fix a crash when closing the window of a Sequence View of a closed
   molecule.

 o Residue Info reworked.  Now we have a master atom.

 o Changed colours of the model/fit/refine dialog in the cootrc.  I
   did this in Erice (hence "Rainbow").

 o Display Manager reworked.  Now remembers where it was put last
   time, what the size and shape was too.  Also, re-worked to use a
   pane to provide a user-changable divider between molecules and
   maps [FvD].

 o Shelx input considerably re-worked with the assistance of GMS. I
   hope Coot can reaad all shelx ins/res files now - even
   centrosymetric small molecules.

 o Shelx compabibility: .pha files are considered as .phs files.

 o Shelx compabibility: .hat files are considered as .ins files.

 o Mutate Sequence dialog auto fit check-button fixed.

 o Reworked the Go To Atom and other Coordinates Molecules option
   menus.  The Go To Atom option menu should now be consistent with the
   residues tree.

 o Difference Map peaks search now tries to put the peaks around a
   molecule, rather than in the map asymmetric unit [PRE FRS]

 o Bad Chiral Volumes now writes to the console when it can't find the
   restraints for a monomer type [Marianne Cuff].

 o print-sequence and print-sequence-chain write to the console, so
   that now coot can do what pdbset's SEQU SING does.

 o Removed the slow and nearly pointless "Import all Dictionary CIFs"
   from the menu.

 o (Jones) "Rainbow" CA colouring mode.  I decided to add this after
   listening to Alywn at the ACA 2005 Patterson symposium.

 o Included various cleanups from Ezra Peisach.

 o Included multi-molecule bond display speed up from Ezra Peisach.

 o "Missing Atoms" in rotamer analysis are plotted as blue instead of
   red [Qingping Xu].

 o Residues with negative numbers now work in the Go To Atom dialog
   [Qingping Xu].

 o Residue type MSE no longer gives "Missing Atoms" error in Rotamer
   Analysis graph [Juergen Bosch].

 o Rotamer graph now updates on model modification [Juergen Bosch].

 o linkage type between neighbouring and flanking residues now
   dependent on the chem_comp.group value in the restraint for the
   residue types [which means that ligands with C, N atoms and
   consecutive numbering don't get linked and fly away] [Bob Nolte].

 o pick cursor index now changable from the scripting layer [Bob
   Nolte].

 o Rotate/Translate in CA bonds mode moves a CA representation (no
   longer a full atom representation).

 o Resolution limits frame in the MTZ column selection widget now
   under the control of the check button.  This improves the usability
   [EJD].

 o Pointer distances now only displayed to displayed molecules
   [Stephen Graham].

 o Reset View has animated zoom - rather than jump zoom.

 o --auto command line argument for autoreading MTZ files [Randy Read].

 o cis <-> trans conversion [Randy Read, Pierre Rizkallah].

 o user-level hooks available for "." and "," pressed [Charlie Bond].

 o skeleton colouring improved [Stephen Graham].

 o Symmetry control re-worked.  Not it is possible to undisplay
   symmetry of various molecules.  Molecules having undergone SSM
   Superposition no longer have their symmetry displayed by default
   [Ezra Peisach].

 o Change the splash screen.

  


Release 0.0.32 "Oranger Hat"

This month, not so much. Been busy with other things as may become
apparent at some stage.  

Anyway, this I am putting out without fully testing, there may be
"funny pick mode" problems - it happened to me once but things got
better using "Clear Pending Picks".

There are several improvements that I don't want to sit on any
longer.


 o Crash on read, close, read, next residue. Fixed.  [Neil Paterson]

 o Animated initial refinement [Kevin]

 o Mutation of nucleic acids [Bill Scott]

 o Change Chain ID GUI [Jan Abendroth]

 o Coot now no longer allows the undoing of changes to a molecule that
   is not displayed [this is not an ideal interface and will be improved
   in future].

 o Fix occasional problem of unreadable MTZ columns [Peter Zwart, Joel
   Bard].

 o Using Ctrl-Z to undo a modification on a second molecule lead to
   problem with subsequently unclickable atoms.  Fixed.

 o Many widgets are now marked as transients (anti-submarined
   (i.e. "stay on top")).  A few of them now remember where they were
   put last time (let me know if there are other dialogs that should
   also be anti-submarined)

 o Multi-model C-alpha mode now available for NMR models [Ezra Peisach]

 o Negative levels in difference maps no longer truncated [Charlie Bond]

 o "Save State" now brings up a fileselection dialog instead of
   writing to an unchangable file name [Dirk Kostrewa]

 o Difference maps read from state file maintain their colour map
   rotation if difference map colours are swapped [Dirk Kostrewa]

 o "Strict NCS" concept added.  The addition of a Strict NCS matrix
   will allow the "expansion" of molecules in the same way that normal
   symmetry does.  Useful for molecules refined with strict NCS in
   CNS (like viruses), I hope (still "in development") [Jonathan
   Grimes/River]

 o "Undo last navigation" bound to "U" key [FvD]

 o Rotate/Translate objects can now be rotated from the keyboard (use
   Ctrl left-mouse and click away from the intermediate atoms) [Artem
   Evdokimov]

 o After Auto-read MTZ, the "scroll" map is the FWT/PHWT map, not the
   difference map [Randy Read]

 o Coot now honours your umask when it creates coot-backup [Gabor
   Bunkoczi]

 o You can turn off the map scrolling by the scroll wheel [Phil Evans]

 o New function to fix nomenclature errors.

 o The top of the Coot's hat on the splashscreen is now more orange -
   less Tajikistan and more India [Neil Paterson].

Release 0.0.31 "Anniversary (Indian Hat) Release"

Many of these changes were written during the recent sleepless nights
in Bangalore.  

Coot is officially 1 today... Does that mean we'll get sensible
release numbering..?  Haha not yet!

 o "Scroll" radio button in the Display Manager to ease the changing
   of the scrolling map [at long last, eh Charlie?]

 o Some drawing speed-up code suggested by Mike Hartshorn.  On testing
   I got 40-50% improved frame rates - YMMV.

 o Fit Loop exported to GUI.

 o Now you can undo the deletion of a residue for a molecule that
   contains a single residue [Joel Bard].

 o Reset View on the menubar.

 o Turn off the cell when either its map or molecule are not displayed.

 o Ctrl-Right mouse now does clipping change (up/down) and
   z-translation (left/right) [actually, this is a more or less a
   feature that Frank liked in Pymol and was in the previous
   release too, but I forgot to mention it] [FvD].

 o Symmetry atom pick, now we can pick any symmetry atom (not just
   ones close to the centre) [PRE bug].

 o Don't draw hydrogen atom in the rendered image when they are not
   displayed [Robin Owen].

 o Internal changes so that the 0th molecule can have a colour change
   too.

 o Diagnostic output checking the reference-structures directory at
   start.

 o Fixed some of Ezra's non-initialized variable warnings.

 o guile auxilary code change from guile-www to net-http.  This will
   affect those who compile.  Considerable speed-up in downloading PDB
   files from an OCA server.

 o More status bar messages.

 o Fixed several option menus that didn't alter the molecule that they
   said they would.

 o Fixed crash on multiple deletes then refine zone.

 o Some functions now say in the console what their script version is.
   (print-all-history-in-scheme) gives a history of commands.  The
   coverage is rather spartan at the moment.

 o Lots of documentation updates, now makeinfo is happy.


--

Release 0.0.30 

 Not much this week, I've been ill and have been improving
 documentation.
 
 o Broken hardware stereo fixed.

 o Delete item now move cursor into "pick-cursor" mode

 o Applied torsionable ligand patch from Joel Bard [not the latest
   one]

 o Several internal changes suggested by Ezra Peisach to build with
   sgi CC.


--

Release 0.0.29

This release fixes the botched 0.0.28 version.  There are some feature
requests too.

 o Status bar: has atom pick info and other things [Jan Dohnalek]

 o Now we can colour by molecule too [Andrea Olland]

 o Update go to atom molecule on close molecule [Phil Evans]

 o Measure Torsions [Joel Bard]

 o Use masked map for scoring of orientations in ligand fitting [experimental]

 o Fixed merging molecule chain problems [Harvard oops]

 o Fixed problem of addition pointer atom residue numbers [Wyeth demo oops]

 o Don't write out wiggly ligand models

 o Use group-settings to unset display lists for maps if uname is Linux
   [by popular demand]

 o Add optional atom-based scoring for residue-density-fit

 o new scheme function: fit-protein which does rotamer search and
   refinement for each residue in the molecule.  Sit back with feet up and
   and watch the fun job.

 o Use the masked map to score ligand positions rather than the
   unmasked map.

 o Makefile.am fix [Bill Scott]

 o configure.in fix [Ezra Peisach]

 o Documentation updates (including the F8 key).

--

Coot-0.0.28 release notes

This is a bug-fix release with a few feature requests added.

 o A crash and generally woolly thinking has been fixed in the Align &
   Mutate function

 o After a chat with Martin Noble, display lists have (optionally)
   been added for maps.  It is not clear if this will help on your
   hardware - for me, it makes my PC worse but my Mac faster.  This
   may address the concerns of Phil Evans and Andrea Schmidt.
   Map display lists are on by default.  To turn it off:
   (set-display-lists-for-maps 0)

 o Delete Item on a symmetry related item now deletes the real item
   (and consequently symmetry copies).

 o Flexible ligands are now pre-regularized (anti-bumped) after
   torsion angle manipulation

 o Chi Angles for MSE fixed [Marianne Cuff/Phil Evans]

 o Chi Angles values displayed [Dirk Kostrewa]

 o New function: de-clash (see documentation) for de-clashing
   sidechains without a map [Kay Diederichs] (Clashing waters can be
   deleted with the validation water checker).

 o Cancel on the Map Colour Selector actually cancels the colour
   selection and takes you back to the colour you first started with
   (instead of doing nothing) [Many people doing the tutorial at
   Grenoble found this one]

 o NCS sequence comparison improved [Adrian Lapthorn].

 o Water searching now tells us the distance parameters it is using.

 o Delete Item now has a checkbutton to keep the dialog alive [Adrian
   Lapthorn]

 o Fix SSM configuration problem [Joseph Toth]

 o Double-click during Refinement gives 2 "Accept Refinement?"
   dialogs.  Fixed. [EJD]

 o Density fit for residue now auto-updates on accepting refined
   residues

 o Various internal updates to make Windows port easier

 o Various documentation updates

   I had been having problems keeping the documentation
   in order - but now I think that the manual will appear spookily up
   to date.

--


coot-0.0.27 has been released.

Fixes issues raised by Kate Kavanagh (alignment and mutate chain
problems), Adrian Lapthorn (coloured intermediate atoms), Ian Tickle
(brief atom labels), Marianne Cuff (water/ligand addition problems).


--

coot-0.0.26

I made an important oversight in 0.0.25.  The ccp4mg utils function
Tree used in chi angles and rotamers was modified and I forgot to
update one of its uses (the rotamers).

So I am releasing 0.0.26 as a fix.

On the plus side, this version has a couple of other fixes and has a
least squares interface and shelx interface that are getting released
sooner than I had planned (these aren't documented in the web pdf
manual yet).

--

0.0.25 has been released.

Updates include:

o fixed crash on .phs data but no symmetry for molecules

o fixed N-terminal add terminal residue crash

o fixed crash on rot/trans of alt-conf selection [thanks Stephen Graham]

o Added chain chooser to SSM superposition

o Fixed symmetry atom picking (which sometimes gave spurious hits)

o more annotation for SSM overlapping results (work still to be done
  here, thanks for testing: MOL)

o NCS tool: Edit -> Bond Parameters now has NCS "ghosts" available for
  display (overlay B chain on A chain)

    e.g. http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/coot/screenshots/coot-ncs-ghosts.png
    The result of a chat with Charlie Bond at Galashiels

o NCS tool: Calculate -> NCS maps: i.e. e.g. overlay map for molecule
  B on molecule A. Does averaging also.

o Fixed various Makefile.am problems [thanks Joseph Toth]

o Real Space Refinement of Water atom now available (it actually does
  a rigid body fit)

o Pointer distances (distances to the pointer - so that you don't have
  to add an atom to a structure before you know the distance of a blob
  centre to the protein atoms)

o Various fixes trying to get rid of accidental "Translate Only" mode

o Delete atoms from the structure "on top" when multiple structures
  overlaid (more work to be done here it's still too easy to
  accidently delete stuff "at the back")

o Fixed occasional problem with MTZ column label checking

o "Filename filter always on" option (needs more intricate widget work)

o moved from COOT_RESOURCES to COOT_PIXMAP (coot will have icons one day)

o fixed occasional discrepancy between the bond parameter molecule
  option menu and the molecule of the bond parameter options

o fixed python function state naming problem [thanks Bernhard]

o Water masking is no longer optional in water search [forced on].  No
  longer possible to put waters on top of existing waters

o Water checker validation tool now available [about 10 months after
  Florence asked for it]

o Experimental "Align and Mutate" feature for Molecular Replacement models

o Option to allow the swapping of colours after refmac (so that the
  new map has the same colour as the pre-refmac map

o difference maps are now by default shown after running refmac

o Tassos encourages the use of "Real Space Refinement" label

o Clicking on "RS Refine Zone" while the delete window is open no
  longer deletes the residue

o Turn off skeletons properly now

o Rendered images now contain balls (as well as sticks)

o In Ca-mode, Coot no longer "runs out of colours" past the 8th chain

o Several corrections to enable compilation without the GSL (but not
  recommended)

o Fix typo in contouring algorithm that occasionally deleted a
  contouring line [thanks Ezra]

o Bond parameters dialog now has slider for colour map rotation - much
  better than text entry

o Fixed "No solvent" view atom indexing problems [thanks Ward Smith]

o Fixed the mask inversion, so we can easily make nice piccies like this:
  http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/coot/screenshots/coot-mask-raster3d.png

o Now using newest CCP4mg code for atom tree (ligand chi angles).
  Note that the tree is built using the clicked atom as its base -
  this is still under development (I'm not happy with it) but may
  improve things

o I'd had a few reports that there were gaps when using Ca Zone ->
  Mainchain. So I tinkered with a couple of filtering parameters -
  lets see how it goes...

o citation banner enabled [the Coot paper has been published - yey!].
  Splash screen amended too


--

coot-0.0.24 has been released.

o Added IRIX case to setup scripts and added COOT_REF_STRUCTS.
  Hopefully that'll put these problems to bed.

o Check the bonds type before making bonds after setting hydrogen bond
  drawing state (Charlie Bond's bug)

o Calphas + Ligands in Sec. Struct. colouring now works (ditto)

o Added a few GUI warnings as per Ezra's suggestion

o Go To Atom widget residue tree improved

o Fixed-up ligand searching dialog - no longer crashes at execute time
  when no ligands found.  Re-worked so that the searching dialog doesn't
  appear unless there are ligands available.

o Re-write of map colour selection and scroll-wheel attachment code.
  Now the maps are enumerated and one doesn't get the option of
  changing the colour of closed maps

o COOT_SCHEME_DIR and hard-wired default directory searching logic
  change

o insertion code support for Go To atom: now Coot displays the
  insertion code in the (graphics) atom label and in the Go To Atom
  residue tree item labels and double clicking on such a thing goes to
  the right residue (you still can't refine it when you get there
  however)

o one can no longer add Pointer Atoms to closed molecules

o Refmac running extra parameters code cleaned up

o Downloaded files go now to directory coot-download, not .coot

o MSE standard residue more sensible now (apparent after mutate
  residue to MSE)

o Substantial re-write of atom naming code in dictionary reading.
  Still not all correct yet but better than it was - it may even be
  faster to generate the geometric validation graph.  Coot can now
  refine NAD and MSE (MSE chi angles still fails).
