   For Release 0.8.8

   o New EDS Location [John Berrisford]

   o Get some RNA - check that base pair restraints generation works
     (user-defined restraints).  Donna M.

   o display ligand distortions, move and regularize, display ligand distortions. 
     Clear generic display objects -> not all graphics objects are removed - they 
     should be.

   o Fetch molecule: acyclovir, (edit?) click Apply
 
   o make a small buccaneer test

   o write a test that runs findwaters 

   o write a test that runs findligand

   o is git-revision-count correctly generated by make-dist-with-rev-and-ww2-put.sh?

   o for master: why doesn't OXT bond to C in GLU in 313 A of 5elv? 
     [refinement branch]

   o remove debugging:

debug:: switch for sequence_view for imol 0 is 0x0

   o resolve the GSL problem. If no GSL fail in configure?  Or perhaps correctly 
     conditionally compile without it (not usage of $prefix/bin/gsl-config)

   o in interface to render: make bonds to hydrogens be thinner.
