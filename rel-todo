--- Items ---

o Distance to symmetry related atom e.g. base pairing in 1d8g

o Add anisotropic radius scaling from Claus. Need to check mails or something
  for scaling code. ::: 1

--- Other Items ---

o have another look at Rama plot ::: 1

o Fix the "Fetch" buttons - new GTK4/glib? :: 2

o "Proportional editing" molecule rotation :: 2
  Actually "fragment" rotation makes more sense.

o Get in touch with Kay for the display of h,k,l as atoms (cif)
* Done. Progress has been made.

o Fix up the rdkit-interface.cc warnings ::: 1

o Atom sphere radius depends on B-factor - proportional to cube root maybe?
  set_atom_radius_by_b_factor_mode(imol, state)
  atom_radius_by_b_factor_scale_factor(imol, sf)

o clicking on "Go To Atom" button should uniconify the iconified dialog.

o draw 9c1h with molecular symmetry colouring :: 1

o load_gltf_model() should return the model index (-1 for failure)

o Fix the "Fetch" buttons - new GTK4/glib? ::: 2

o Add anisotropic radius scaling from Claus. Need to check mails or something
  for scaling code. ::: 1

o have another look at Rama plot ::: 1

o "Proportional editing" molecule rotation ::: 2
  Actually "fragment" rotation makes more sense.

o What is going wrong with Chemical Features? ::: 1
  wrong colour for hydrogen bond donors

o plug a mouse into the map and do middle-mouse drag for translation
  (and check ctrl-left-mouse) ::: 1

o write a blog-post for "APPLY-SYMMETRY::" label
  and up date the documentation.

o add a button for "vertex gradients for maps" in the EM module. ::: 0.5

o boron is grey - it should be #FFA07A or so - pinky beige

o 6yzn - Overalaps etc validation hangs/is slow.

--- Other Items ---

o try texture atlas for text - make a new test app from scratch :: 4

o WTA carbohydrate :: 6

o what does "RenameVerticesAndTriangles()" do? Do we need it?

o Cross-out "Screenshot" unless we have OpenGL 4.2 or later :: 0.5

o Highlight the chain neighbours in the Rama plot. Bring back the green square.

o how do I make the HUD buttons have rounded edges? Can I make the health bars
  have rounded edges?

o Rama and Rota graphs validation graphs have terrible scaling - difficult to fix :: 4

o Have a look at contact dots during refinement - with the 3a3a say, there is hang, and the
  final refined structure is shown - there is no animation :: 2

o Have a look at the poly-TRP problem of sequence identification. :: 4

o  It was a strange bit of code in get_group().
   Now the issue is duplication of the model on writing. mmdb bug.
   Solved now? Am I using the right version?

o 1geh B-factor colour ramp looks wrong :: 1

--- Done Items ---

o plug a mouse into the mac and do middle-mouse drag for translation
  (and check ctrl-left-mouse) ::: 0.5
* Done. No problem.

o write a blog-post for "APPLY-SYMMETRY::" label
  and up date the documentation. ::: 0.2

o undisplay the logging pane/box/widget at startup then resize. ::: 1

o load emd_321143.map, increase the map radius - [ and ] if the
  maps are all em or all not em, then the radius change should only apply
  to that map type ::: 0.5

o load emd_321143.map from the command line - why is the view not in the
  middle of the map? ::: 0.5

o 6yzn - Q3Q Overlaps etc validation hangs/is slow. ::: 1

o boron is grey - it should be #FFA07A or so - pinky beige ::: 0.5
* Done.

o add a button for "vertex gradients for maps" in the EM module. ::: 0.5
