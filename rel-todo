   For Release 0.8.8

   o coot-probe: does it work with symmetry?

   o coot-reduce: does it work with symmetry? (this is more tricky and less useful)

   o Fetch molecule: acyclovir, (edit?) click Apply
 
   o lidia: import 
   CC(C)C[C@@H](C[C@H](O)[C@H](Cc1ccccc1)NC(=O)COc2c(C)cccc2C)NC(=O)c3cccc(N)c3
     change amine for meta to para - SMILES updates but drawing doesn't.
 
   o Pyrogen chirality: Using CCD files as input, make a dictionary and 
     either validate the coordinates (dictionary vs actual) chiral volume 
     or minimize and validate coordinates

   o Pyrogen: add command line arguement to keep the coordinates from the 
     input CCD/mmcif file

   o when mutating to MSE atoms become HETATMs.

   o Ligand Builder -> Open [cif dictionary] Failures
     110 (butyl carboxylic acid - Oxygen formal charge)

   o Fix make check on test chemical features

   o comp_id C23, look at the thumbnail, or residue->2D, see that the Oxygen atom
     seems chiral - is the bond the wrong way round?

   o like sphere refine, but onlyn select residues that are linearly related to
     the active residue (Hmm... how to do the GUI for this...?)
     -- Chris Oubridge

     maybe autozone 2 will do?

   o 3ggi sfs don't convert with mmcif-to-mtz.

   o make test should do something useful [Tim Fenn].

   o if the chain has a TER and we add NCS residues, then the
     old/current TER should be deleted.  Write a test first.

   o enable mol2 reading to pyrogen

   o Ligand Builder -> Open [cif dictionary] Failures
     110 (butyl carboxylic acid - Oxygen formal charge)

   o Get some RNA - check that base pair restraints generation works
     (user-defined restraints).  Donna M.

   o display ligand distortions, move and regularize, display ligand distortions. 
     Clear generic display objects -> not all graphics objects are removed - they 
     should be.

   o make a cootaneer test

   o write a test that runs findwaters

   o write a test that runs findligand

   o is git-revision-count correctly generated by make-dist-with-rev-and-ww2-put.sh?

   o for master: why doesn't OXT bond to C in GLU in 313 A of 5elv? 
     [refinement branch]

   o remove debugging:

debug:: switch for sequence_view for imol 0 is 0x0

   o resolve the GSL problem. If no GSL fail in configure?  Or perhaps correctly 
     conditionally compile without it (not usage of $prefix/bin/gsl-config)

   o graphics-info-modelling.cc: for (int iflash=0; iflash<2; iflash++) { 
	allow flash of 1.

   o in interface to render: make bonds to hydrogens be thinner.

   Lukasz Wojtas:

   1) From res file When I try to show ANISO atoms WinCOOT stops working and shuts down. 

   2) exported coordinates and U's round off like in shelxl

      EXPORTED: C1    1  0.501129985  0.671778977   0.518324018
      SHELXL:   C1    1  0.501130     0.671779      0.518324    11.00000    0.24195

   3) When I try to fix coordinates temporarily by adding 10 - WinCOOT treats 
      it as actual coordinate and not fixed one so atom is shifted. 

   o when you mutate from an MSE the mainchain should revert to ATOMs

   o import imidaloze from lidia in coot. c.f. stand-alone

   o put the bond, angle, plane, nbc most distorted bonds in the refinement lights dialog

   o think about this leak:

==9640==

   o Fix make check on test chemical features

* Done.
