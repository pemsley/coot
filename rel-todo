o maybe make bold b-factor and occupancies in atom info in status bar
  std::string atom_info_as_text_for_statusbar(int atom_index, int imol);
It will do for now.

o check chemistry - extra hydrogen atom when making a link.

o does "make mask" have a place in the GUI in Coot?

o where did we get to with alt conf colouring or selection (in Coot)
  e.g. untangle chalenge challenge. Look at alt-conf-switcher.py

o "Phosphorylate this residue" doesn't work.
* Done.

o make a function: to update bonds without updating bonding.
  Useful for dynamics.
* OK, done - now I need a means to genate molecule position updates.

o check chemistry - extra hydrogen atom when making a link.
  Example? Reported by Clemens?

o Clemens: edit the alt conf-ids interactively.
  Residue Editor is not enough. Clarify with Clemens.

o Consider atom ids in output from libcootapi/chapi when gemmi is used.
  We need label_atom_id and label_segid (not the auth version of those)

o coot: let's get bansu integrated - for those who don't have acedrg

o Coot: 2 (EM?) maps - don't scroll the map that is not displayed

o libcootapi/moorhen: density correlation for a cid

o libcootapi/moorhen: renumber residues function

o libcootapi add a mask for the fourier shell

o libcootapi: using model and gaussian surface export a mask soft edge (0.0 to 1.0 in floats)

o moorhen/lhasa: use bansu for link generation

o coot:
  contour level for map 1 is 0.187223 pending
  tell me what the step size is also.

o dot and comma don't work for rotamers

o install cctbx (conda install) to get mmtbx.probe2 to get new dots.

o molprobity reduce has updated the hydrogen bond distance (it seems?)
  libcootapi should follow - actually, use distances in new monomer library.

o how to represent missing ligand atoms?
  Draw them in black with a white outline?

o Lucrezia: table of bond and angles and distances vs model table in moorhen

o Moorhen: auto-fit-rotamer without map.

o Delete link in Coot

o Moorhen: environment distances to symmetry-related molecules.

o Robbie: 3lem: B2-B3 link

o in moorhen, maybe coot, draw the dodecs close to CA - not gapped
  witht the rama ball missing.

o Moorhen/libcootapi test fsc with more map pairs

o Coot: go to atom dialog and use numpad enter key. Needs a computer
  with a numpad!

o Coot: bring carbohydrate, in WTA mode, to the gui
  i.e. 4d514356326ca57852d349f9a2e34b7815688673 needs user interface.

o ligand code KCX: make pdb from chapi and read it into moorhen - with hydrogen atoms
  In Lucy's example some hydrogen atoms were disconnected.

o add_molecular_symmetry add this to moorhen/libcootapi

o calculate the bonds up-front and use a container that can generate the bond
  and atom indices from a mol or atom selection that has updated atom positons
  (from dynamics, say).

o set status 0 for more than 100,000 (or so?) vertices
  Make an api function for the user to set the max vertices
* Done

o "de-dust"/hide dust. Maybe the contour level needs to be sent also.
* Done.

o given the residual map, can you find the centres of the blobs? I have in mind
  doing the cryo-EM tutorial non-interactively. Use rings and shift? Use low-resolution
  maps - resample for more speed.

o give me a list of "clashes" in the validation tools in moorhen

o add low-pass filter

o add solvent mask - combine the maps from the gaussian surfaces

o check "Fix nomenclature errors"

o rebuild_fragment_using_dbloop function needs more work.

o this fails to create the directory for the dictionary (it seems):
INFO::       Reading coordinate file: /Users/pemsley/.cache/Coot/coot-download/pdb4dab.ent

o read in lib/data/monomers/metals.json - add it to the disribution

o check power-scaled map with 1gwd atom map.

o try 8b0x in flatpak coot. Colour by chain. Missing dictionaries.
  Make an easy way to download all the missing dictionaries

o get_atom_position() add to chapi

o add sphericity test (current analysis) to chapi

o do we have "B-factor analysis" i.e.. show me atoms with B-factor
  more than 70 (or so)

o rdkit mol -> mmcif - for output from layla

o 6ZV ligand - does it display correctly?

o crash on run unit tests:

o Ctrl-S should add something to the log.

o check that these work as expected (Martin Maly anom test):
   coot.set_map_radius(7.52)
   coot.set_map_radius_em(52.60)

o Assign sequence gui needs fixing..
* Done.

o Let's move the light for different shadows in Fancy Mode

o in cfc, give me a button that shows the chemical features
* Done.

o halogen ligand interaction - investigate.

o refine a structure with the wrong magnification and look at the
  distortion of the bond lengths. I have done some work on this,
  but where is it?

o CFC should also check for pi-stacking to the protein
  (i.e. not just internal chemical features)

o do a better job at the 3d "icons" for chemical
  features - so that I can tell what it is from the shape.
  Maybe use blender to make the "icons"
  Can you indicate the number of contributors somehow? Size?

o what is PLIP(ify) Interaction Key?
  https://github.com/volkamerlab/plipify
  Salentin, S. et al. PLIP: fully automated protein-ligand interaction profiler.
  Nucl. Acids Res., 2015, 43 (W1): W443-W447.
  Uses conda - what does it depend on and can it be used outside of conda?

o show the PLI interactions in 3d (in moorhen too)

o external Rama torsion restraints for servalcat

o make "Environment Distances" an overlay

o make downloading emd map an overlay

o Ctrl-M should merge molecule (active ligand) into other model.
  Or just rewrite the "Review/Accept Ligands" dialog.

o fix relocatable installation of coot-residue-density-fit
  see the homebrew install

o put contact dots on the residues around the ligand.
  How about hexagonal slabs (instead of balls) as
  an option? (Tricky to get the orientation correct "between" atoms).

o pickable ribbons.
  Big Job.

o Highlightable/pickable genericic objects

o double-click on a symmetry atom to label.

o does get_ligand_validation_vs_dictionary() do good things?
  Does it give ceus?

o Bonds and angles validation on 2d diagram from chapi
  as svg.

o arwen, alejandro, santosh, dorothee

o have another look at the PAE drag box for residue selection

o Take a cif molecule, copy it, move the copy to symmetry-related position
  merge with first and write out the cif. Is the header (secondary structure)
  preserved in the outpute cif?

o Robbie: 3pdt is Mg and should be K. A2.

o moorhen (and coot) ribbon diagram coloured by b-factor

o read in a molecule, make a molecule with DNA models. Refine DNA, then
  try to undo refinement of DNA. Fails. 8v1w.

o check that hydrogen bonds are displayed correctly.
  See update_hydrogen_bond_mesh()

o fix the map caps. Make it work in moorhen. Single colour mode and joined edges.
  Slice "solid" maps.

--- Other Items ---

o "Flood the blob with dummy atoms" - useful of pomgnt2

o import cif dictionary from string.

o Add ability to rotate view around z axis :: 0.5

o auto-scale the make-a-difference map
  think about create power-matched option also? It's in chapi :: 1

o colour stops for b-factor analysis, rather than colour wheel. :: 1

o have another look at Rama plot :: 1

o Add curl fetch stuff to chapi api. Use modern accession codes.

o address-sanitizer for coot

o Fix the "Fetch" buttons - new GTK4/glib? :: 2

o "Proportional editing" molecule rotation :: 2
  Actually "fragment" rotation makes more sense.

o Get in touch with Kay for the display of h,k,l as atoms (cif)
* Done. Progress has been made.

o Atom sphere radius depends on B-factor - proportional to cube root maybe?
  set_atom_radius_by_b_factor_mode(imol, state)
  atom_radius_by_b_factor_scale_factor(imol, sf)

o draw 9c1h with molecular symmetry colouring :: 1
  turn on set_colour_by_ncs_chain(imol, 1)

o "Proportional editing" molecule rotation :: 2
  Actually "fragment" rotation makes more sense.

o try texture atlas for text - make a new test app from scratch :: 4

o WTA carbohydrate :: 6

o what does "RenameVerticesAndTriangles()" do? Do we need it?

o Cross-out "Screenshot" unless we have OpenGL 4.2 or later :: 0.5

o Highlight the chain neighbours in the Rama plot. Bring back the green square.

o how do I make the HUD buttons have rounded edges? Can I make the health bars
  have rounded edges?

o Rama and Rota graphs validation graphs have terrible scaling - difficult to fix :: 4

o Have a look at contact dots during refinement - with the 3a3a say, there is hang, and the
  final refined structure is shown - there is no animation :: 2

o Have a look at the poly-TRP problem of sequence identification. :: 4

o  It was a strange bit of code in get_group().
   Now the issue is duplication of the model on writing. mmdb bug.
   Solved now? Am I using the right version?

--- Done Items ---

o check for g.display_control_window() usage - they should
  not be needed these days, I think.
* Done

o make "Copy Fragment" an overlay
* Done.

o get rid of generic object functions from graphics-info.h
  Put them in aa new file along with
  bool is_valid_generic_display_object_number(int obj_no) const;
* Done

o add header guard to gizmo and gensurf headers
* Done.

o change stringify_error_message to stringify_error_code
* Done

o rename Cartesian.h to Cartesian.hh
* Done.

o Move Molecule Here should be an overlay
* Done.

o Talk to Stuart:
::function get_atom not found - out of 386 docstrings
::function get_atom_using_cid not found - out of 386 docstrings
::function get_residue not found - out of 386 docstrings
::function get_residue_using_cid not found - out of 386 docstrings
* Done

o Move Molecule Here should be an overlay
* Done

o move make_directory_maybe() to take std::string arg.
  Will need to change the header. Maybe a new header?
* Done.

o side-chain 180 should do a syn/anti flip for nucleotide bases
  i.e. rotate 180 around C1-N1 (or N9)
  Make a video. In chapi too?

o what are the chi angles for ASN? In sequons? With link
  to NAG?
* for Lucrezia. Use top 3000 filtering on modern structures to
  get new reference set.

o User-defined filename filter for coords file open
  https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.FileFilter.html
* Assigned to Jakub

o make a file that maps CCD-id to RDKit Canonical SMILES.
  (is the SMILES in Acedrg output the canonical SMILES?)
* Looks good. Jakub to continue this

o Add split water to new coot
* Done.

o install latest chapi, python3 import coot_headless_api
  then the molecules_container_t gives an error message
  about COOT_PREFIX
* Not for me.

o std::bad_alloc when fitting waters in chapi - maybe.
  Put some protection in.
* Done.

o filename filter for coords file open
  https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.FileFilter.html
  Done. But now I think that this is not what Oli wanted.
  There should be a user-defined globbing string.
  Add a GtkFileDialog to a dialog. See google docs notes.

o multi-select for maps
* Done

o 2vf7: alphafold model tutorial? Or is it too close to the actual model?
  *It's too close.  Good idea though.

o bernie comments
* Done.

o refine_residue_using_cid "CHAIN": too much debugging information
* Done.

o Fix curlew (download to wrong directory)
* Done.

o make a function that returns the secondary structure for libcootapi/chapi
* Done.

o print the key bindings
* Done.

o add-water should have a key-binding
* Done.

o swig should not be a dependency if building chapi
* Done. And done.

o Process Stuart's outliers file ::: 1
* Done

o fix the colour wheel in B-factor analysis ::: 1
  1geh B-factor colour ramp looks wrong

o Add Metals to Coot startup, Moorhen and chapi ::: 0.2
* Done.

o Save symmetry coordinates.
* Done

o what is the radius of gyration? Make a function. ::: 1
* Done.

o remove GEMMI hack at top of atom-selection-container.cc ::: 0.2

o make a function that returns the secondary structure for libcootapi/chapi
* Done

o key-binding for smooth bonds
* Done.

o layla needs a wrapper and to be moved to libexec
* Done.

o get rid of debugging on get_h_bonds()
* Done. Nice.

o move make_directory_maybe() to take std::string arg.
  Will need to change the header. Maybe a new header?
* Done.
