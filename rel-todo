   o use refinement to make an cis-peptide - then relieve it - the
     refinement gui should track this - does it?

     graphics-info-modellings "cis peptides"

   o read in ejd/BLG.pdb, look at the terminal - we only want/need one such warning:

WARNING:: failed to find dictionary entry index for GLB

   o the coot page should say "reference"

   o TRS in thumbnail view - e.g. in 3h6d.

   o chiral restraints in 0BR (and others, presumably)

   o unsigned int

   o 3pt6 looks hideous when using PBDe -> Get From PDBe, but not from
     EDS.  Why?

   o Glyo add NAG with ASN-NAG


   o Refine a bit of of the DNA in 3pt6 and see that the nbc seem to be failing.

   o show bumps between bases in Environment Distances.

   o investigate why python doesn't use readline properly on hal

   o 4wtb has 2 data sets, they need to be parsed separately (clipper/cif).

   o does the phenix PDBe Python gui work as expected when there is no
     cif file at the url (e.g. the accession code is wrong?).

   o are the oxygens on a nitro O and O-? (eg ligand in 4CCC).

   o Sarah ligand: comp-id 23H: PDB accession code is 4MDS.

   o write a store.py wrapper that transfers files to pc:~/store

   o pyrogen -r "" CCC does nothing and should return a non-zero exit status.

   o CA Zone -> Mainchain will change the sequence to ALA - this is wrong
     when the CAs have the right sequence.

   o valgrind when using PDBe recent structures.

   o does the PDBe Python gui work as expected when there is no refmac?

   o clean up coot-download usage in lbg-drag-and-drop.cc (need get_directory() function 
     which does the same as the scheme function). std::pair<bool, std::string> 

   o Alexander B Crash:

   o Sarah's ligand: had tertiary amine with an amino group - it
     should be sp2 hybridized, but was not (N+) - and rdkit failed.
     23H - thank you Sarah. 

   o import an elbow dictionary cif as an "MTZ, cif. phs" file. Crash.

   o Fix up the map interface of HOLE.

   o is there anything going wrong with the minimisation of 
     can-you-minimise-this-qm-ext-frag-3-123.pdb?

   o Can you fit the ligand in 3fw1 (gleevec)?

   o in find ligands, the dialog expands the sections incorrectly when
     pulled.  Try making the dialog longer when you have 5 maps.

   o anisotropic refmac from coot interface: REFI BREF ANISO.

   o yellow/brown sulfurs, green for Cl, F, darkbrown Br, I purple, Orange P,
     purple Na, Li, K, dark green Mg, dark orange Fe.

   o Does refmac now work when you start it from a directory for which
     you don't have write permission?

   o consider ignoring waters in the clash score of auto-fit-rotamer
     and delete them if they bump into the sidechain after fittting.

   o Sphere refine doesn't use alpha helical restraints. It should.

   o Flev this: BLD in 4lsa

   o is sphericity test being applied for find waters? 

   o add a test for molecule(const std::vector<clipper::Coord_orth> &atom_list,
		             const std::string &residue_type, std::string atom_name,
		             std::string chain_id) - are the residue numbers correct?

   o with enhanced-ligand, do you get a sane code-path if you do 
     File -> SMILES?

   o pyrogen -M default

   o Do probe dots get updated locally after a sphere refinement?

   o Add a test: if pyrogen is built - does it run correctly? 
 
   o bonds to hydrogens should be thin in Colour by Chain mode

   o Do we get the correct hydrogen bonds with Acedrg dictionary (and
     pyrogen dictionary) for 824?

   o 1nlt: A351: there's a tangle at the Zinc.  Don't make a disulfide bond
     if there's a LINK to a ZN on this CYS.

   o Eleanor's problem: Make the difference maps peaks dialog general
     and link it to the register_interesting_positions_list functions.

   o compile without guile and run with --no-graphics (crashes on mac).

* No longer, but there's a problem (crash) reading template_key_bindings.py
  Need to test this on home/work computer.

   o Default for add waters should be something other than Pointer
     Atoms if possible.

   o Find overlapping atoms (on top of each others)

   o Ligand Check

   o add test for carbohydrate building.
  
   o Hydrogenate region when reduce is not found - give me a dialog.
     Or grey-out the function if it is not in the path.
 
   o review simple-restraints.cc:5131 H-bumps

   o at het_group_group() to API c.f. het_group_n_atoms()

   o always warn of cis-peptides in refinement dialog - Oliver Clarke 
     (pephaps in non-Pro cis-peptides)

   o Colour by chain: ligand 607A 3CJ in 4qyq has a triple bond to the S.  Why?
     Ligand drawn twice?

   o bundle raster3d.

   o stroke characters for HUD thumbnails?

   o given a SMILES string, is it in the PBD (SRS)?

   o launch coot from / and try to use pyrogen to build from a SMILES string

   o Give me a rotamer score in the refinement accept dialog. John Spurlino

   o refinement should refine CYS disulfides only when theres a DISU
     (or whatever) record.  Add a function to add a DISU.

   o experiment: use Rdkit with pdb perception to generate molecules and 
     compare them with molecules generated from reading the cif.

   o when you write out the PDB file, add a checkbox that asks to
     Rationalize Links? - which throws away links that are more than
     3A. Bob Nolte.

-----

   o permissions on Ubuntu 14.04

* Done.

   o Draw -> Additional Representation -> Ball and Stick - balls are
     too big.

* Done.


   o thumbnail for O 5463 in 3e5r:
     the N in the nicotinamide is N+2: incorrect!
     Also the Oxygens have charges and Hs.

* Done.


   o Does LBG File->Fetch molecule work now? Xamoterol?

* Yes, sort of - it depends in a complex way on libcurl (compilation?) 

   o absolutise() needs to be able to handle an empty string. Miguel Ortiz-Lombardia

* Done

   o Pro-CD -> CA and C NBC... what to do?

* Done.

   o planar peptide restraints: are the distortions correct?

* Done.

   o crash: Vinoth:
